The tower soon launched crackling energy into the clouds tearing the very sky asunder. As the cracks in the sky grew, it became evident that whoever armed the ancient tower plans to tear a rift into another plane. A catastrophe that could prove more lethal than the Worldwound. As the earth begins to tremble once again, it is clear that something must be done before Golarion itself is torn apart.\n",

      "*Costly Spell Components:* Anyone trained in Spellcraft can salvage costly material or focus spell components from magic items. Each attempt requires destroying the item and 8 hours of work. An item can be broken down into a powder that can be used in place of gemstone dust as a material component. Otherwise, the item must have a spell requiring the component in its construction requirements to salvage that component. A successful Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields materials usable in place of that spell component worth two-thirds the item’s creation cost (one-third its market price). If you fail the check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed without yielding spell components, but you can try to salvage them again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the spell components are ruined.\n",

      "*Raw Magic Item Materials:* Anyone with an item creation feat can salvage the raw materials from magic items for the creation of new ones or repair of existing ones. You must have the item creation feat required for that item to salvage its raw materials. Each attempt requires destroying a magic item and 8 hours of work. If the item’s price is 500 gp or less, you can salvage its materials in only 2 hours. A successful Craft or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields raw materials worth two-thirds the creation cost of the destroyed item (one-third the market price). If you fail the skill check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the skill check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item made of similar materials or that shares any of the creation requirements as the original. Including the majority of the materials allows you to automatically meet any construction requirements of a new item that the salvaged item also required and reduces the construction or repair time by the proportion of the new item’s construction materials that are salvaged (with the usual minimum creation time). Spellbooks and formula books can be salvaged for magic inks and paper usable in formula books, scrolls, and spellbooks.\n",

      "New idea, Kitsune (with fox shape, and the tail feats again), soulbound summoner unchained, get the deaf oracle curse so you have constant silent spell and you can use your tail for somatic components, and your eidolon can be an Ancestor so it has the Kitsune change shape racial trait and can appear as human (or a different eidolon subtype and cast alter self on it). Also, take that feat that lets you hide your spell casting with a bluff check. Now you can pretend to be a pet fox, wag your tail to cast a spell then hide it with a bluff check, and even though you're deaf you can still essentially hear because you have the eidolon link ability which is essentially telepathy with your eidolon so it can just tell you what's going on/what's being said\n",
