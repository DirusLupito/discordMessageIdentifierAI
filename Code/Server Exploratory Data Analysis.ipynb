Now that the dust has settled, treasures have been pillaged, and travelers have returned home, silence has washed over the frigid tundra. After three years of peace, these chilling wastes have again proven to hold much more than initially appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter months of unprecedented tremors shook the mountains of Golarion’s pole, the tallest tower of the Nameless Spires began to emit a strange field of magic. As quickly as the activity stirred the abominations that once called the Spires their home to flee, they shortly returned both greater in number and with strength unheard of for mortal creatures. The tower soon launched crackling energy into the clouds tearing the very sky asunder. As the cracks in the sky grew, it became evident that whoever armed the ancient tower plans to tear a rift into another plane. A catastrophe that could prove more lethal than the Worldwound. As the earth begins to tremble once again, it is clear that something must be done before Golarion itself is torn apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wandering Skum is again organizing parties, hoping the few remaining heroes are strong enough to save this land from the ancient powers that echo through the ice and snow. While locals fear the tower has been charging for millennia and that this was their true purpose, those who saw the mythical might of the warlord that lurked within that Sarkorian tomb can sense his power in the Spires.',\n",
