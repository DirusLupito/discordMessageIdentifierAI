author4,"But tldr is just this unless you are a crafter or caster that needs expensive components (diamond dust, onyx, etc)"
author4,So may need to buy a higher lvl scroll
author4,Yeah but the CL of the scroll does need to be 2x whatever the items CL is
author2,Make whole scroll is 50gp x CL and dc 20 + CL UMD
author4,"*Costly Spell Components:* Anyone trained in Spellcraft can salvage costly material or focus spell components from magic items. Each attempt requires destroying the item and 8 hours of work. An item can be broken down into a powder that can be used in place of gemstone dust as a material component. Otherwise, the item must have a spell requiring the component in its construction requirements to salvage that component. A successful Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields materials usable in place of that spell component worth two-thirds the item’s creation cost (one-third its market price). If you fail the check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed without yielding spell components, but you can try to salvage them again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the spell components are ruined."
author4,"*Raw Magic Item Materials:* Anyone with an item creation feat can salvage the raw materials from magic items for the creation of new ones or repair of existing ones. You must have the item creation feat required for that item to salvage its raw materials. Each attempt requires destroying a magic item and 8 hours of work. If the item’s price is 500 gp or less, you can salvage its materials in only 2 hours. A successful Craft or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields raw materials worth two-thirds the creation cost of the destroyed item (one-third the market price). If you fail the skill check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the skill check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item made of similar materials or that shares any of the creation requirements as the original. Including the majority of the materials allows you to automatically meet any construction requirements of a new item that the salvaged item also required and reduces the construction or repair time by the proportion of the new item’s construction materials that are salvaged (with the usual minimum creation time). Spellbooks and formula books can be salvaged for magic inks and paper usable in formula books, scrolls, and spellbooks.
."
author4,"*Raw Crafting Materials:* Anyone trained in the Craft skill can salvage raw materials from equipment for use in crafting or repair. You must carefully dismantle the item to be salvaged, resulting in the item’s destruction. If the item’s price is 1 gp or less, its materials can be salvaged with only 1 hour of work; otherwise it takes 8 hours to salvage crafting materials. A successful Craft check against the item’s creation DC + 5 yields raw materials worth one-quarter the item’s price. If you fail the Craft check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item of the same materials and reduces the construction time by the proportion of the new item’s raw materials that are salvaged (minimum 8 hours).

author4,"**Wrecked Magic Items Rules:**
Repairing a magic item requires material components equal to half the cost to create the item, and requires half the time. The make whole spell can also repair a damaged (or even a destroyed) magic item—if the caster is high enough level.

author4,"Echos of the North (Part 2 of 2): The Fractured Spire
Three years have passed since the inhabitants of the World’s Crown raced to find an ancient Sarkorian tomb. Now that the dust has settled, treasures have been pillaged, and travelers have returned home, silence has washed over the frigid tundra. After three years of peace, these chilling wastes have again proven to hold much more than initially appears.

After months of unprecedented tremors shook the mountains of Golarion’s pole, the tallest tower of the Nameless Spires began to emit a strange field of magic. As quickly as the activity stirred the abominations that once called the Spires their home to flee, they shortly returned both greater in number and with strength unheard of for mortal creatures. The tower soon launched crackling energy into the clouds tearing the very sky asunder. As the cracks in the sky grew, it became evident that whoever armed the ancient tower plans to tear a rift into another plane. A catastrophe that could prove more lethal than the Worldwound. As the earth begins to tremble once again, it is clear that something must be done before Golarion itself is torn apart.

The Wandering Skum is again organizing parties, hoping the few remaining heroes are strong enough to save this land from the ancient powers that echo through the ice and snow. While locals fear the tower has been charging for millennia and that this was their true purpose, those who saw the mythical might of the warlord that lurked within that Sarkorian tomb can sense his power in the Spires."

Legends and whispers among the travelers of Golarion's Crown speak of a lost tomb hidden in the deepest reaches of the frozen High Ice. The tomb, supposedly belonging to the ancient Sarkorian Warlord Borgbreill would likely contain riches and treasure worthy of the god-king's mythical status. In light of the recent closing of the Worldwound, travel in the region has seen a recent surge and the rumors of this frigid tomb have become increasingly popular throughout settlements near Sarkoris. It's only a matter of time before someone heads North and stumbles upon the tomb and the riches held within. 

Luckily for you, the Erutaki village of Nutaqq that borders the High Ice is rumored to be organizing parties for people hoping to find the tomb and strike it rich. Perhaps the echos of this lost tomb could contain your chance at glory."

author1,tmr good

author6,"I dont think randall would be able to tomorrow, unless he shows up super late"
author6,Its nothing dangerous
author4,Or maybe thats anesthetics
author4,I thought people who were diabetic had to be careful with meds though
author4,At least theres that
author6,I am medicated as hell though so I don't feel anything
author4,That makes my tooth hurt thinking about it
author6,No bueno
author6,Infected tooth
author4,F you good?
author6,Nothing besides having a swolen face
author4,Randall and Oliver both called out and Im having trouble importing my map so I may need to push Gnome back
author4,Hey guys what to your schedules look like tomorrow
author4,"I try to level you guys after 3-4 sessions
But only for important stuff not just random scuffles with patrols"
author4,It does
author2,Paup gonna start cracking necks if this kobold hole doesn’t have a level in it
author11,dazzling display
author1,why toliet rat
author11,The closet people soon
author10,one momeny
author6,<@146626274066956288> <@492768651389435909> Pathfinding

Also Foundry will be up most of today is you guys wish to adjust characters"
author6,If it were to be ok anyone i fell like it would be on me since I have experience with it
author4,So guys where is the Trident rn?
author1,neutral evil
author4,"But thanks that narrows down what I should do
I sat down to start prepping Zeds and was like fuck what if they go to x"
author6,So what you are saying is that there is a seige going on
author4,Im not sure if I described this well but both sides at Zeds were fully entrenched
author10,Gotta introduce aurelius
author6,"Tbf I doubt us going to zeds would help much, The fight should be done well before we could get there"
author2,We should go through places on the way
author2,But that’s far
author1,"zed top priority, then krollin"
author2,I say we do 1 and then travel around grabbing the allied forces
author7,||I like smallsburogh||
author6,I say 1
author6,"I see there being like 3 different ways we could go
1. Go save zed
2. Go do some clandestine shit in smallsburogh
3. Go south and find krilin / onry"
author4,"Hey <@&927426307514581042> can I get a definitive stance on where ya'll are trying to go after you leave Caput's
Rn I'm not sure what exactly I need to formally prep"
author6,Button to make dice go brrrr

author4,Just ya'll setting up macros
author4,VTT will work
author5,sounds good
author4,I was gonna leave it open all of Monday
author5,I think we should just do it prior
author6,"Is next week going to be a ""session 0"" where we try to get vtt to work, or are we going to try to get that done sometime before session?"
author10,pog x2
author4,"So we should be good to run both next week and the week after <@&927426307514581042> 
Sorry for my brain damage"

author4,"Hey can ya'll go through the stuff in gnome hoard and tell me what ya'll took, what ya'll left with Zed, and what ya'll trashed"
author4,"Thinking along the lines of:
You roll a nat 1 -> 
Roll another attack -> 
If the confirmation would hit resolve original as a normal attack -> 
If the confirmation would still miss then fumble"
author4,Hey how do yall feel about trying a house rule of confirming fumbles? Instead of an auto AOO?
author5,das fine
author4,Guess we cancelling today then
author11,Sorry gonna have to skip today I gotta work on Civics shit
author6,i should be good
author4,"Btw Tomorrow at 5?
<@&927426307514581042>"
author4,It would have followed you guys unless you told it to stay
author6,its choice
author6,prob either with us or zed
author4,Question. Where is the dog currently?
author4,But they provoke even when stepping into a square
author4,They do
author6,Cuz that would look funky
author6,Do tiny and smaller creatures still have a 5 foot step
author4,Hi good Im Noah
author2,I’m good
author6,i should be there <@!151489352164311040>
author10,I forgot I was gamemaster
author10,I guess
author4,5 good for yall
author6,Should be
author4,Yall good for tues
author4,Guess again Im Noah headass
author1,i might be colorblind but at least im not deaf
author4,If you weren't colorblind you could probably tell
author6,If you cannot tell then you are not a master of the game
author1,"which gamemaster is which, i can't tell l"
author4,Thats the week after
author6,You don't have spring break?
author6,Wait this Tuesday?
author4,"Btw i cant do gnome this Tuesday
I have a physics test that night"
author4,"<@&927426307514581042> Tonight
Be there or be square"
author6,Works for me
author4,"5 work for ya'll?
Also one caveat is I'll have to cancel whenever I have a Physics Exam"
author6,Seems like
author4,So it seems like Tuesdays is the play?
author10,character has been made
author4,Letter for free days
author4,You make a tempting bargin
author6,Make randall the guard that krilin was fucking with
author1,he can not be the dog
author5,but the dog is cool
author6,He can be the dog
author4,"Today @5 <@&927426307514581042> 
-Randall cause he lacks character"
author10,Sounds good to me
author4,Thats true
author5,tiny rather
author5,I'd do +2 Dex +2 Cha cause they are already getting +2 attack and AC for being small
author10,Can it have a charisma buff at all
author4,<@318536129727168512> ?
author4,"Faeire:
Humanoid (fey sub type)
Typicall Alignment: CN
Tiny
+2 Dex, +2 Cha, -4 Con, -2 Str
20 ft fly (avg), 10ft ground
+2 Bluff
Fey Magic (Faerie fire, Presdigitation, Dancing lights, Ghost sound 1/day)"
author10,What should stats be?
author10,"No invis, those limits on flight"
author10,I'd be down
author4,Works for me
author2,I’d say can’t fly with heavy and 1/2 speed on medium
author4,Honestly I'll prob say he cant fly if he's carrying more than a light load
author4,Works both ways
author4,Yeah I know
author2,But sure
author2,I meant for Randall
author4,Time for **reach spell**
author2,Also a lot of spells need you to be within like 50ft
author2,So it’s not a big diff
author2,Flying up 100ft still has you in range of a bow
author4,Yeah flying negates all ground hazards and melees
author2,Cause that still puts you out of melee range
author2,Not really
author10,ik but I think a 30 foot hindrance makes flying much worse
author2,Those stats are also balanced for D&D
author6,Just give it to him as a spell like once ever
author10,Take that away then
author4,That one you sent has invis as a spell-like 1/day which is a big hmm
author6,He doesn't get to know why though
author4,Tjs fat +8
author6,"If its tiny i dont really mind
beacuse kinda that works better with my build"
author10,Especially if it's limited to 30 feet up
author10,Also idk why you think flight is so important
author10,Was thinking of the default one
author10,Lemme show you the bases I found
author5,10 RP
author10,Or maybe something else idk
author10,Or a plus 2 to one stats with the minus 4
author10,Could do either +1 to 2 stats with that minus 4
author10,It does not have thay
author5,+ the base -2 to con
author10,Small things are not durable
author10,I would more than happily take -4 con
author10,THAT'S WHAT I SAID
author5,-2 to con for each yes
author10,trying to figure that out
author5,"2 questions
Will you be tiny
Will you have a fly speed"
author5,is it a fairy?
author10,<@151489352164311040> <@492768651389435909> <@589289513788899348> <@531348109347782656> would you care if I had a homebrew race if it was balanced
author4,Hey <@&927426307514581042> ya'll fine if Randall joins
author4,Here btw
author5,im good
author5,depends on if we're going out to eat
author5,my dad mentioned valentines dinner so I might have to leave in a bit

author1,same but i will try my hardest to get everything done in time to be here
author11,"Perhaps, I might have to work on some other stuff today. If I do you guys can just play my character for me if you want"
author5,<@&927426307514581042> you know
author4,Btw Gnome only going to 7 tomorrow I have work I need to do
author4,"Don't forget to level up, also 5?"
author5,<@&927426307514581042> on the morrow
author4,Btw you guys all gained a hero point when you leveled up
author4,@everyone You are now level 2

author4,That's funny actually
author4,Nvm Alchemist just get it
author4,The only correct answer lmao
author4,Smh the idea is you pick it when you take the trait lmao
author11,"Sí, also not sure yet I’ll let you know when I pick one"
author4,Btw <@492768651389435909> what spell you take with eccentric caster
author6,That works
author12,"<@458413180893397022>  :game_die:
**Result**: 1d5 (4)
**Total**: 4"
author4,Here's how we fix this
author6,I'm sorry i have to formally withdraw from the AP due to religious differences
author1,pretty sure i could fail it but its unlikely
author4,"The same for other common animals like cats, horses, fish, birds, etc."
author4,It probably mean you have no idea what a dog does
author6,"so your telling me i probably have no idea what tf a dog is
so i just saw some eldrich looking ass furred creature and decided to just roll in the mud with it"
author4,That's the DC to id a normal dog btw
author4,I'm pretty sure <@!589289513788899348> can't fail it
author6,its a miracle that im smart enough to intimidate someone
author6,i have like 7 int
author6,Do you think im smart enough to get knowledge's

author2,And 3 for period
author2,For space
author2,Bark twice
author1,how do we know when we hit the last letter though
author5,rinse and repeat
author5,it understands common so we can go through the alphabet and tell it to bark when we get to the right letter
author6,"we give it a pen and paper and let it ""write"" its name"
author6,"fuck the owner
we let the dog chose its own name"
author4,"Like he has one
Ya'll just don't know it"
author4,I like how no one ever asked the owner the dogs name
author4,Shame unhindering shield is banned :(
author6,before i realised the -1
author6,"i was thinking

author4,That why you passing on buckler
author6,it is what i have been doing

author1,dude were off for MLK day sob
author4,If we do Monday we may have time to start if character sheets are done
author11,My character would have to exist to do so
author2,Smh no one else posting character pics
author2,No school and snowed in sounds perfect
author11,I’m not free until after 2:20 every day except the weekend
author2,What about Monday?
author1,free after 12 most days but my schedule is very inconsistant
author6,Im free after 4 on tues and thurs and after 11 all other days

author4,"Question
Is anyone opposed by me possibly scraping general for a text classification project?
Authors would be anonymized into integers"
author2,If anyone is unsure of what one of the options means let me know
author1,knew it

author2,||Spoilers: They're in your walls||
author2,Neither is Fable
author1,im not even in charlotre
author6,Can confirm I can currently hear oli shooting up heroin
author2,you should take it off
author2,They're in your skin
author2,I think you are on drugs
author1,did you just @ or is my discord hallucinating
author2,You don't necessarily need to want to play in whatever it turns into. Just collecting info.
author2,Campaign Interests
author2,If I did it was not on purpose
author6,idk if this is something you did or if I somehow did it but these started filled in
author2,I love when maybe 100%
author2,"No it probably wouldn't
- I won't be on campus anymore in a month
- I like foundry
- There are a lot more online people"
author13,"Since I'm not on campus anymore, is it gunna be in-person? If it is, obviously I wouldn't be able to join. Figured I'd ask."
author2,You don't necessarily need to want to play in whatever it turns into. Just collecting info.

author1,"no i like him, but every single comment under the post says the exact same thing"
author4,Yeah Irori ain't boring he just doesn't do much
author6,Don't you talk shit about him he is perfect
author1,"i love how everyone in that thread has the same comment: ""damn, the ||boring|| one survived"""
author4,||Irori|| wildin in this one
author2,checks out
author2,reincarnation and amnesia should be added
author2,I plan on it once I finish one other campaign that has been on my plate for a while
author13,Are you making a new campaign?
author6,Languages (wait I'm stupid I had no idea what the question was)
author2,like magical girls lmao
author2,so everyone has like a better familiar or something
author2,The fun thing I was thinking of was like all the way up on prevalent and all the way down on power
author2,"How prevalent are gods
How powerful are they
How religious are people"
author2,This ended up becoming 3 scales
author2,"If anyone has the time could they look at this and let me know if they think anything is missing
https://forms.gle/ndYSdS3ryvDPyyhe8"
author2,That goes hand in hand with the civilization scale
author13,Flora / Fauna levels. Like how intense they are in areas.
author13,Myths and legends maybe
author2,I will do a scale for that one
author13,Religions is an easy one
author2,Right now I have post-apocalyptic and super heroes
author2,"what are some setting traits that are not related to amount of magic, amount of civilization, or time period"
author2,I am happy to once again be able to watch a video and use foundry
author2,timeout is pretty epic
author4,"Oliver was requested I pass along:
""You are a stinky poopoo baby head"""
author2,Oliver has been timed out
author4,Tristin is in fact the April Fool
author6,And either way this is probably another divinity
author2,and the points he made in the video made sense
author2,Just got out of the car ride
author2,I see
author6,Do you have it
author4,Its 4/1
author2,What I saw
author6,I remember them saying their next thing was going to be non-DnD
author4,"I thought that was just a rumor?
If it confirmed"
author2,Apparently people who made Baldurs gate are gonna make a pf crpg
author4,Gorgar in space
author6,tmw the leshy is a space fungus
author2,There are things you guys have interacted with already
author2,Said it a couple times
author13,Oh 100%. I'm already prepping a sci-fi setting for my other group i play with. Since they wanted to try new starfinder once it's out as well. We tried dnds Spelljammer but it was too magic-y for sci fi.
author4,That is true but it's hard for me to prep stuff if I'm not super feeling ity
author13,"I love sci fi. But it's also easy as hell to homebrew. Just new stations, planets, factions, etc."
author4,"If I ran Starfinder it would def be in the base setting
I'm not a huge sci-fi guy but I may run one-shot stuff here and there"
author4,Would be news to me
author6,IIRC didn't tristin say he's planning to include starfinder 2e in the westmarch world
author13,Yes. Please.
author4,Ok boys we gonna fiddle with the playtest when it releases?
author4,I see
author2,My desktop discord has something where I get combo for each letter I type
author4,A what
author2,I got a fuckin combo breakers on discord
author2,wah steam is buggin rn so I cant see it
author4,Tristin fiending rn I'm sure
author4,I get force tho cause like nothing is immune to force
author4,Blood bender here we go
author2,I think you could reflavor wood as bone and just flip vitality to void
author2,also spirit but that is understandable
author2,only ones that are missing are like void and force which were basically their own kin in 1e
author2,"all physical, cold, acid. electric. fire, poison, vitality"
author2,Yeah wood gets vitality
author4,Can they do positive?
author2,I feel like there should be a way 2e kin can do void
author4,Idk if hed go for that one lmfao
author4,Apparently he played through the Choral stuff as well
author2,Invite to the west march lmao
author4,He mentioned that he was currently working on a homebrew kineticist archetype as well
author2,"had to ""nerf"" her"
author2,Nola moment
author4,"He asserted that his Earth Kineticist was ""a little much"""
author4,He has played 1e since it released evidently
author2,they play or nah
author4,Man I just had a 20min discussion with my English teacher about Kingmaker
author14,*flashbacks to Sans one shot*
author14,"I'm not sure how they compare in terms of functional complexity, but I definitely know that Bards are a lot easier to build than Clerics lmao"
author4,Ultimately depends on what my team wants to do as well since its a group thing but
author4,I think Bard if prob easiest then
author4,Prob Ranger
author2,What is 3rd class
author14,"Then you also have to explain what being Holy and Unholy does, and what affects deity choices have on your character"
author2,I don’t know the extent of the class explanations so I can’t give a great gauge
author4,Honestly I think Cleric is easiest
author4,Yeah but they have focus spells and stuff which complicates stuff
author14,With the Universalist being distinct from other wizards in terms of functionality
author14,"Because they've just got focus spells and a subclass, whereas Wizards get two subclasses, focus spells, and drain bonded item"
author14,"In the Player Core, I'd say Bard probably"
author2,Bard or wizard
author4,"In 1e it would have been sorc easily
But they are weird now"
author14,And Witch
author14,I think we can rule out Druid
author6,Prob sorc?
author4,"I want to do a caster
But I really dont know which one is easiest"
author14,"Basic classes are probably much easier to write, too"
author4,"That's so fair
This assignment was gonna be for beginners (so basic classes)
Though is people want guides for classes I'd be happy to make them"
author14,My abridged description of how the ability worked was three paragraphs long
author14,Thaumaturge would be helpful lmao
author2,all xmen movies watched

author2,what is it
author4,Me when my Pathfinder project proposal get approved
author4,Me when paizo con
author2,We will now get stuff like the dragons and prophecies automatically
author2,Pathfinder on Foundry VTT Community and Volunteer Development Server #paizo-blog
author4,That one designer that left seathing rn
author2,They can prob still look like the left but that is like the savage version
author2,also ghouls are more like vampires now which I like
author13,Gotta play genetics
author13,Custom kobold bloodlines time
author6,"1. become strong
2. get kobold edd
3. Kobold is now my child"
author4,"I see
So what you are saying is
Kobolds in hell"
author2,Which tend to be dragons
author2,Their eggs acquire traits from nearby strong creatures
author6,They are now eastern kobolds /s
author4,What is it
author2,Nah the new thing is way cooler
author2,Kobolds are officially unrelated to dragons by blood
author2,Monster Hunter
author14,"Gonna go kill Fatalis real quick, I'll get back to you all in 3 weeks"
author2,Multiple Attack Penalty
author6,Return to Salem
author2,Was having a dream that had something to do with the pf witch class and woke up to a call from Winston Salem
author2,apparently that list was in the player core
author2,all dragons btw
author13,"""What do you use as a weapon"" ""oh I just carry a trebuchet around"""
author6,I mean there is an archtype for seige weapons...
author4,In 1e a large creature could use a cannon like a gun
author13,Lmfao probably
author2,I think that'd be ruled as a siege engine
author14,"Brilliant Plan:
Step 1) Both west marches go to space
Step 2) Colonialism
Step 3) War
Step 4) Profit?"
author13,All I need to know is how strong I need to be to hold onto a ships cannons without a ship attached
author6,"It makes sense, the teleportation is space technology"
author6,Tmw the leshy is a space wizard
author14,Van Karthy mention????
author13,Third character planned to be man with biggest gun he can find
author2,like there have already been things you've seen
author2,I will say be aware that stuff is already in the works for it to appear in my west march
author2,pf2 and sf2 will be compatible
author13,"Wunna recreate my poor character from my last try at starfinder 1e, man with biggest gun he could find"
author14,My west march is getting a space expansion
author14,I think that's dropping this summer
author13,I wunna play that when it comes out
author13,Is there any news on starfinder 2e?
author1,yoo ||neyths|| safe lets go
author13,Gotta do something with it when you run out ammo
author15,once a ranged weapon always a ranged weapon
author2,dagger pistol having thrown 10ft is quite funny
author4,Observe as the other occult is a bard dragon and his edict is seducing the party
author2,some of the other traditions may be in opposition within themselves
author4,"Thats fair enough, I generally run my dragons with a tolken bend so they are more lethargic"
author2,I look forward to seeing the edicts and anathemas of these dragons
author2,than red
author2,Yeah I meant more lawful and less kill everything
author4,"All the others are intellegent enough to reason with, though they are still assholes and quick to anger"
author4,I mean the only unreasonable chromatic is white
author2,Could end up being a dynamic like the gods
author2,The diabolic seems much more reasonable than red
author4,Divine ones will be sanctified most likely so those def will fight
author2,I dont think so but unsure
author14,Or Adamantine and Horned?
author2,The article said it defends hells armies
author14,Do Mirage and Fortune counteract eachother in that way?
author4,Cause diabolic is basically red
author4,But realistically the new divine is prob gonna be more like gold
author4,Replace brass or whatever the adhd dragon was
author4,Azata dragon go crazy
author4,Other occult may be stealing bronze dragons deal since conspirator reminds me of blue
author14,Oh wait they were lawful good
author14,"And archons do stand in exact opposition to them, at least under old alignment"
author14,"That makes sense... diabolic does imply devils are involved, rather than demons"
author4,My guess is the other divine dragon is gonna be an archon type thing
author14,"I kinda hijacked that entire segment of magic in a not-so-subtle way for my West March setting, so it'll be interesting weaving it in"
author14,I'm curious to see what the other Occult one's going to be
author14,So maybe it would make sense for those two to be in opposition
author14,"Yeah, I just figured that divine magic covers both the upper and lower planes and there's the whole holy vs unholy sanctification thing going on"
author2,I meant the 2 dragon types
author14,I guess I don't know enough about pathfinder's cosmology
author2,They aren't necessarily counter parts
author14,So the other divine one should be angelic or something like that
author14,I assume that there will be two types of dragon for each magic type?
author14,I always found that little bit of design cool
author14,"There was something charming about being unable to identify the type of dragon while relying on darkvision, though"
author2,old dragons are just not gonna get mentioned anymore
author14,I like it better
author14,"In Evermore's setting, I also grouped dragons based off of type of magic"
author14,Is that replacing the old chromatic/metallic stuff or joining them?
author14,Oh new dragons?
author2,Monster core gets released 27th
author2,"Arcane: Mirage and Fortune
Primal: Adamantine and Horned
Divine: Diabolic
Occult: Conspirator"
author4,||Erastil|| dying would have been kinda sick tho this one is prob one of my favorites
author4,"All I do is win
https://paizo.com/community/blog"
author14,Oh cool!
author4,Archives could get renamed Memorial of Nethys lol
author6,"Dam, I guess they theory they were killing off nethys so they wouldn't have to update archives was false"
author4,"Also as a note
I'm pretty sure the ability on Whose Cry is Thunder can be used with a melee weapon"
author14,Oh yeah that one’s cool
author4,I like killing people in the past personally lmfao
author14,I will count my original one as close enough
author14,There are multiple spellings
author14,Oh wait
author14,Gáe Bolg apparently
author15,that'd be it
author14,Gaé Bulg?
author14,I know how to say the barbed spear out loud but can’t spell it for the life of me
author15,that's cool as fuck
author14,I forgot what the feature was called though
author14,There’s also the barbed spear thingy
author15,i heard cu chulainn
author14,Cú Chulainn moment
author14,I like all of the mythological references in the Exemplar abilities
author4,He's basically Maui
author14,That would also match with the pacific islander aesthetic of the exemplar art
author4,A lot of storm/ocean/nature stuff
author4,That's why I'm wondering Gozreh
author14,"During the reveal stream, one of the devs was very stressed about a mention of an ability involving rainbows"
author4,I've considered that
author14,I wonder if the abilities are flavored towards the god that dies
author14,Oh cool thanks
author14,I can't find the animist + exemplar playtest
author4,My man Norman Gerber gonna get outed
author4,Be like yeah the gods know now but ya'll don't
author4,My favorite part is even if they do this one they prob won't give us a name lmfao
author4,Since Arazni is getting promoted
author4,"My bets at this point is limited to
Gozreh, Iomedae, Zon-Kuthon, or Abdar"
author4,I like that we are getting alt timelines for each one tho
author14,And that kills him
author14,Or maybe Norgorbur's identity before he ascended is discovered
author4,"I think it's possible but unlikely
Would be cool tho"
author14,What's your opinion on Rovagug?
author4,Yeah that's my point lmfao
author14,It's overdone because DnD's done it 3 times already
author4,"Lmao
Nah Nethys dying would be boring
""I killed the god of magic"" is overdone
For the same reason I think Gorum is safe"
author14,"Plot twist: Nethys is dying, and they didn't give AoN access to the remaster early because they're trying to make it canon"
author4,"Itn War of the Imortals one of the core deities is getting perm killed
Paizo's been teasing it by revealing a safe deity every week or so"
author4,I have a car bomb to deactivate <@589289513788899348>

author2,something glitched
author2,Laurena Howell
author7,me rn ^
author7,really giving Kristen a hard time aint yall
author4,Poor Tristyn
author4,Yeah unsure who he's talking about Tristun
author13,At least Tristan isn't like the people who purposefully join investigations to kill themselves and end the quest. I've had that happen before.
author7,nah you'll carry 😇
author2,3 decently powerful dudes considering he isn't in master
author7,hunt three dudes without fainting?
author2,bro is on a mission and I do not want to fuck it up for him
author4,Helping Oliver friend learn system
author4,Wouldnt want to deny them that
author4,Okay but what if the creature is suffering from warmth?
author2,That one is basically undead
author2,something like that
author2,similar to the level of the deities from rage of elements I imagine
author2,I think edicts and anathema won't be that extensive unless it is a more complex creature as well
author4,"Thats fair
Generally Id prefer to have both though"
author1,i don't like meat gaurdians as a concept
author4,He he skinskitter
author2,I just looked it out of interest a few minutes ago
author2,2e non N mindless (that aren't undead) btw
author2,and flavor the rest of the character
author2,When I use those statblocks I usually just use them for stats
author2,Since a lot of npc creatures come from APs or other material I imagine they'd end up having ideals tied to that setting
author4,"""I like money""
""I dislike not having your money"""
author1,i think you'll find the level 1 rogue has very enlighteneing ideals surrounding his place in the world
author4,"Yeah and thats my main issue with it
I cant go look at the rogues stat block and see if hes a prick or not
I have to skim a paragraph about his ideals"
author2,That is a much more case by case basis
author2,I doubt they will tie edicts/anathema to humanoid traits (if tie them to traits at all)
author4,Which I dont think any useful info would be gleaned from the human trait
author4,The vast majority of my monsters are also humanoids though tbf
author1,i could solo him
author2,This guy kinda sick
author2,That could also be a case of player metagaming
author2,In the case of monsters its overarching so I think it is flexible to say these ones don't do that
author4,Fair but that feels like a different kind of limitation that rules lawyers will take to seriously
author2,like blink dogs for example
author2,I would really appreciate it being easier to know what other monsters are enemies or allies
author2,"Tactics yes, but things like mortal enemies or allies usually aren't present (unless it got something like child scent)"
author4,The wikis and descriptions are usually more supplemental
author4,I mean generally I feel you can get a good feel for monster tactics from theirs stats/abilities
author4,"In 1e at least there are several non undead mindless creatures that are evil
Usually cursed stuff but"
author2,did that a few times last night
author2,right now for some monsters you have to comb through a description and the wiki to get a good feel
author2,The system can def make it easier
author4,I mean if interactions with enemies boring thats on the Dm and/or players frankly
author2,That is the case right now though. Since most mindless (not undead) are grouped under N
author4,"That is another complaint Id have
Cause sure I know how a spider or centipede behaves
But how exactly am I do determine how a black pudding or another creature Ive never seen behaves"
author2,and could make interactions more interesting
author2,"I do think it may be a bit more complicated for pulling things out on the fly, but when prepping it would make understanding motives and goals easier"
author2,I'm saying that in general not a response to anything'
author2,Will also have to wait and see if mindless stuff even gets them
author4,You say that to the guy who has the check undead traits weekly
author2,I think if this were the case it'd be like that at first but you'd eventually be like oh standard undead edicts got it
author4,"Id say its alright
But 2 letters is a lot quicker reference for Joe Shmoe the average rogue than having to check all the traits and read the description to get a feel for that"
author2,in most cases just based off a monsters description
author2,I think alignment is so basic that it can be understood without it actually existing
author2,but it'd be a good guideline similar to alignment
author2,and then some monsters may have stuff saying they don't follow those exactly
author2,"I think the best outcome might be tying some edicts and anathema to traits like undead, unholy, holy, etc"
author2,I'd have to wait and see how it looks in monster core
author15,Big agree
author4,Opinion alignment is better for (most) monsters. Edicts and Anthema are only really better for players.
author2,checks out
author4,They call
author4,The numbers
author6,In the first paragraph you did not replace severed
author2,That way something like flanking doesn't fully negate it
author2,bumping AC thing by 1
author15,good idea
author2,Added stuff about healing
author15,"and under limb, specifiy the limb"
author15,"limb, eye, jaw would be three good targets for that"
author4,May also wanna do the jaw thing cause you could add eyes as something to target
author2,I'll change it to Maimed then
author4,Severed kinda indicates you fully lost the limb
author15,that'd work better
author2,Nah I'll change the target to jaw
author4,May wanna change term from severed then
author2,It isn't actually severed. Just the general term for the effect. If it auto kills I'd prob have to make it be more vp than the others
author4,No head prob = dead no?
author16,ive always heard charisma casting as being enforcing your will upon the world
author4,No charisma casting is more your conviction
author6,Isn't force of will literally what charisma casting is?
author4,"He seems more Wisdom based with a strong presence
Calls his spells more from force of will than though charm or faith"
author15,he's definitely a charisma caster
author15,ill take gandalf being a paladin
author16,dude could throw hands
author16,gandalf is a paladin
author4,"However I would still argue cleric fits better as Gandalf isnt really a full caster
He typically engaged in melee in a way typical fantasy clerics are portrayed"
author16,(also very apparent with how 5.5e immediately took that idea lmao)
author16,particularly with how some classes can access different lists depending on subclass
author16,the new way spells are categorized is great
author16,drawn from class specific lists
author4,Yeah and your spells were still arcane
author16,"1e Celestial Bloodline didn't give the entire cleric spell list (since they worked differently), but it did give 9 spells from it"
author16,gets the divine spell list
author4,Cause bloodline didnt change spell type in 1e
author16,Angel Bloodline sorcerer
author4,Im like 90% sure it isnt in 2e unless its some weird archetype
author16,"it also exists in dnd5e, and pf1e"
author4,"That is a thing that exists in 2e (which I forgot about)
I was just being more general in tabletop"
author16,though I think a divine sorcerer would fit just a bit closer
author16,i agree with the cleric assessment
author16,he's definitely not a bard
author15,i argue bard
author4,"Opinion
Gandalf would be stated a cleric not a wizard, his magic is divine in nature"
author2,yeah in the abyss
author4,I also used to be able to see wasteland but that is now banished as well I presume
author4,And I can peer into the edges of the abyss
author4,My favorite
author2,you and fable can see most of it other than the abyss
author2,no I just like to limit it
author2,west march request and groovy
author4,Wait are you at max channel count
author4,Which 2?
author2,I deleted two channels yesterday so now I get to add one for this 🙂
author2,"Was originally thinking weapons would be like 
Tier of weapon similar to attack bonus rune
and tier of material/crystal or whatever is damage rune
but seeing as that seems to have not worked out well with pf2 and a lot of people thinking abp is default
I think I'm gonna do tier of weapon like special material
and material/crystal as like property runes"
author2,I did savvy cause I also liked it
author4,I kinda like Savvy
author4,"acuity is close sounding to agility
And acu may be confusing if characters have an ""ac"""
author2,I want something shorter. other 2 I see are logic and acuity
author2,savvy is nice sounding
author2,"I wanted something that covered wisdom and intelligence
I originally put mental but felt that was to vague 
Insight works in my head but I could see how it could be confused with other rpgs' version of sense motive"
author4,"Looks fine to me
Though you may need to rename insight since that typically means something else in rpgs Ive played"
author2,and me
author2,I'll pick this back up tomorrow when the crowd is better rested
author2,similar to pf but combo int and wis
author2,"thinking strength, agility, endurance, charm, insight"
author2,thoughts on the name Emberfall Requiem
author2,they said before end of december
author2,in other news Archives 😔
author2,cause balancing that shit is extra work
author2,I'm not doing standard spellcasting
author2,"and now ""magic ore"" exists"
author2,kinda thinking modern world gets a magic bomb dropped on it
author2,more magic item use
author2,but not spellcasting
author2,gonna do magic
author2,aight looks like not fallout exactly
author2,the fingers are pushing against each other. which will come out on top.
author2,I need to decide on this before I can do basically anything
author2,"Very Fallout 👉 
More Standalone 👈 
?"
author2,magic or no magic
author2,unsure. Maybe immediately if I have reloading.
author2,I think ttrpg does that automatically basically
author4,How soon do you get extra actions
author4,One action system is easier to balance but can make the game feel too simple
author13,Fallout VATS mechanic
author2,and then similar to pf2 at later levels you will get extra actions for certain things
author2,or like on action + step
author2,would a one action system be bad?
author2,how close should this be to fallout
author2,I think that'd end up being somewhat waited against the players and/or more GM intensive (dealing with EvE). I also still have some problems separate from pvp that are difficult to deal with and balance.
author17,"It doesn’t necessarily have to be pvp, you could have other groups of people built similar to players"
author2,I still want to do something with this d6 system
author2,I may transition to a fallout system
author2,You def aren't the sole reason for that decision. I've had doubts about it
author2,I don't think many people are waiting on it. I'd rather make something people'd enjoy then go further.
author13,"Nah dont be like that man, ill admit i was a little harsh. But I mean if you got players don't let me cause you to give up. But I will likely not be joining."
author2,I planned to mitigate some of those but I guess their will always some. idk if I want to continue at this point
author13,I've only played one pvp based ttrpg and that's what happened to me so I'm no expert but it was not a good feeling lol
author13,"That's why I don't like it. It can be like making a mage class and literally everyone else builds anti-mage and it's like ""damn I guess I have no fun"""
author2,fair. man
author13,"Nah it's pvp in general. Doesn't matter if it's even coin flips, it's gunna be rough if someone fails everything due to specific build counters or never being lucky."
author2,also you don't have a single character across games
author2,this isn't a d20 system which I hope may make a difference
author13,Not the biggest fan myself
author13,Pvp is hard
author4,I am unlikely to play then so my opinion is invalid lol
author2,There may be some pve type stuff but mainly pvp
author4,Is it pure pvp or
author2,Before I continue I want to ask what people want/expect from a hunger games style ttrpg?
author4,Its also not rolling cause 7 isnt touching 8
author2,Same with 4 17
author2,That also ig
author4,That dice layout is screwy shouldnt 8 and 13 be opposites
author7,is it the account pfp
author2,Anyways not that
author2,1% now
author13,2% battery charge ya damn phone
author2,Can anyone notice the thing in this image
author16,Playing a charisma trickster:
author4,Like make x npc like you and you can lich on em
author16,"Trickster does stay in the crpg though
Trickster is very funny"
author4,I think theyll hybridize it since the crpg makes it kinda gamey
author4,"Yeah in the crpg the mythic classes are more creature based Angel, Demon, Dragon, etc

The Ap has mythic paths based on character achetypes Archmage, Trickster etc"
author16,Legend is just an absolute gigachad who's just a random mortal but has a level cap of 40
author16,With the exception of Legend
author6,They are probably change mythic a lot either way to fit in more with 2e
author16,Doing certain mythic paths where you ascend as a certain type of creature (angel/azata/demon/lich) vs more standard powers
author2,but story
author2,oh idk bout rules
author16,Since iirc they way they did mythic powers changed completely between AP and crpg
author2,If it gets the kingmaker treatment it'd probably go more off the game then the 1e version
author4,+the game is pretty popular so
author16,Redeemer Queen is based
author4,I mean her backstory entry on archive is like yeah she used to be an evil mf
author16,"Yeah but it's just a bit scuffed considering how different Nocticula is in current time
Could lead to some confusion"
author2,I think kingmaker still happens at the same time doesnt it
author4,Like it can still occur in the same in game year
author4,I mean a remaster doesnt have to change the timeline
author16,The other thing that would make Wrath of the Righteous a bit difficult to remaster is the fact that pre-ascension Nocticula is a pretty major player
author2,I think the brevoy part is the main thing strapping it down
author2,you could change that though
author4,And Brevoy in general
author4,But it does have a timeline I think cause Vordekai and Armag
author4,That is valid
author4,Anyway time for some light reading on the remaster
author16,"Though kingmaker could happen at pretty much any time
Given it takes place in the Golarion Official Battle Royale Zone (tm)"
author4,I mean King got a 2e remake and Runelords has like 3 different versions so
author16,Aren't they just straight up killing a god in that one
author16,"And yeah it completely screws with the timeline but who cares
Arueshalae, my beloved"
author2,cause mythic was introduced by wotr so I'd say it be soon after if not with the rules
author4,Like Kingmaker got
author4,Yeah I think they will port it as an anniversary edition
author16,Yeah the rules would already be there
author16,Yeah but they undid that so we chill
author2,but I feel like wotr wouldn't be far behind if they add mythic
author4,Owlcat is based (except for that data scraping thing)
author2,okay yeah
author16,"A Wrath of the Righteous 2e remake is also pretty much guaranteed to be successful, considering the CRPG (owlcat, my beloved)"
author4,Cause I was hoping for a port of mythic
author4,"Hmmm
I thought you just said tgey were mythicing"
author16,I don't see anything about it
author2,it was a couple months ago
author2,I believe I sent you a message about this
author2,I think so
author4,Wrath was?
author16,Wait seriously
author2,it was announced
author16,So great time to redo WotR
author4,For the one with exemplar
author4,Though I think they are adding mythic rules
author16,I *mean*
author16,I'd love to see that
author4,I have a feeling that will be a minute
author16,I hope they do a 2e conversion of Wrath of the Righteous
author4,Plan to run it 1e
author4,Though this is the anniversary so a certain group of enemies got nerfed
author6,Probably could find a 2e conversion if you really want to
author6,"Smh, runelords should have been christmas ap beacuse they are arisen"
author4,Its also known for the most tpksI believe
author16,Oh lord
author16,Is that a 1e ap
author4,This is a threat
author2,what I was guessing to. Just covering my bases.
author16,looks like AoN font
author2,||Assuming that is archives||
author2,That is pre remaster text
author16,"i mean yeah
it is"
author4,I think this is funnier
author16,considering thats basically the replacement for evil
author16,i dont get why they didnt just use unholy
author4,"<@244474569102983168> may have some explaining to do
Cant believe he'd soil the wholesome of our sessions with his summons"
author4,I think they just went to a thesaurus and picked something close to unholy
author6,Please tell me wholesome/unwholesome is now just a trait things can have
author16,interesting word choice
author4,Bad news guys zombies are in fact not wholsome 100
author2,<@458413180893397022> heads up I plan to use aid
author2,I have devised a character
author14,Because that feels fair
author14,"Ehhh Imma probably decide what I want to play first, then optimize that"
author15,"I'm not exactly sure how I'd get immunity to mental and auditory effects, but I'll try"
author14,"Oh wait, like looking at the stat block?"
author14,She deserves no mercy
author14,I will murder Mariah Carey
author14,I'm building a 10
author2,"On a scale of 1-10 how much should I spec towards killing Mariah Carey
1: I build a character using none of the context
10: I am immune"
author13,Can't talk to women confirmed
author4,Careful I'll run it
author4,Uhhh yeah from what I remember that one was fine
author2,with the fountains
author2,<@458413180893397022> did you like the Caravan's gambit one?
author18,You could just make them word riddles.
author7,your a picture
author6,"This, a picture can tell a thousand words, and 1 picture is a lot easier to look at than 1000 words"
author2,I think more visuals are needed if they are gonna be difficult
author4,"Counter point
I think we both suck at writing puzzles lol"
author2,I think I understand fully why kindergarten puzzles are used in ttrpgs. Any time we try to do anything harder people start tweaking and disassociating.
author2,I dont drink soda anymore. I guide others to a treasure I cannot posses.
author2,Checks out
author4,That is a threat
author4,Tristin gonna satiate both his Dr Pepper and Dice addictions at once lmao
author6,That is on the fine line between a good and a terrible idea
author19,I'll look over all the resources once I get home
author2,49er role has been created for those in charlotte
author2,was wastelander
author2,<@&1020589184437714995> it has been done
author2,I've got the server down to 40ish channels so far
author14,Hello there!
author6,Presumably to replace the one they are killing off
author6,They made another one of arodens fuckers into a core diety
author4,Guilds/Businesses and Dungeons
author2,If I allow purchasing property what kind of buildings/roles would you be interested in?
author4,Everyone knows communisim makes any song 50% better
author4,Ah kobold bards must throw down then
author18,Also wouldn't that mean than Native Americans where proto communist?
author18,Ah makes sense.
author6,I pulled a big stupid and slept at like 6pm
author18,Why are you up at 2am on a Monday?
author6,"""Kobolds practice a primitive form of proto-communism"""
author6,<@458413180893397022> this was in the playtest for the new classes they just released
author4,I still believe Cleric and Druid are the best classes in the game meta wise though
author4,Yeah but at high level I think barb and fighter beat it out
author2,The champion is still cracked
author4,The reanimated medium was a cool concept
author4,Had my favorite archetype in 1e
author4,"No it was kinda mid meta wise
But really fun mechanically"
author13,I've never looked into playing it seriously.
author13,"I feel like I personally would love the animist as you explained it, but it is a shame medium is somewhat missing still. Was it badly balanced in 1e or something?"
author2,"Watching the stream back
Animist seems like between summoner and sorcerer
They also are talking about medium
They are telling lies about the medium
The champion spirit could diff a fighter at least at low level"
author13,Oh thats somewhat cool.
author13,Oh fair I guess that could be it
author13,Animism and whatnot is all I know related to that word
author2,Animist seems like medium which is my favorite 1e class
author13,Like soul magic?
author13,What the hell is animist
author20,Splendid thank you
author2,That’s the next thing
author2,Check out west march channel at very top
author20,What should i do about this
author20,Gamers i would like to no longer be absent
author18,https://youtu.be/7pdjd5T3eUU this looks fun.
author18,Just checked I still have it on hope they fix it soon.
author7,"i mostly do it to use any emoji anywhere <a:PenguinDance:779731073004339220> 
but the other stuff is cool <:shrug:858187229779460116>"
author7,oh yeah i forgot about that
author6,"It's still hidden in there, but it doesn't look like it really works anymore
If you want to check it out you just have to tap dark mode in the settings like 10 times and it should appear"
author18,Imagine paying for discord.
author7,imagine not using mars 😔
author2,Looks like they removed it
author4,There was a black?
author18,Did discord remove the black apperance setting cant find it anymore. And my screen is in regular dark mode now just changed on me today.
author2,It sounds like with the 2es it will be easier
author2,Some but it would def take some work to cross over
author13,"Certain rules carried over I thought, but I could be wrong. Sorry then haha"
author4,I dont think it was outside of being 3.5 edition based
author2,No sf1e was like half way between 1e and 2e pf
author4,Maybe they are gonna release an Ap with some time travel chicanery
author13,With pf1e
author13,Thats how starfinder 1e worked too I believe
author7,I was trying to send the monocle and had a spasm
author2,Apparently pf2e and it will be cross compatible
author13,If 2e allows me. I shall do the same
author13,"I played starfinder 1e twice, and I just went for the biggest gun I could both times"
author1,"i would be so down, it sounds awesome"
author4,Maybe we can actually try this edition <@318536129727168512> lmao
author13,"Oh fuck, a new starfinder? Hell. Yes."
author4,Kingmakers been spoiled
author4,Mikmak no 😭
author2,It’s cause both always die in horrible ways and never of old age
author13,Quite the controversial topic to say out of the blue
author2,Kobolds are like hamsters
author13,Plus it'll open more potential for goals and such
author2,creates more objectives
author2,I think the scarcity will honestly add some fun
author4,Fair changes
author1,"hey, so this may or may not interest some people, but i found out there's a tabletop shop in waynesville now. it's called katmandu games, and it was pretty cool whenever i ran by today. you can host games there for free and use some of their stuff like maps and terrian, and they have events and stuff on a schedule every week. it's right next to the mountain eye near walmart. here's their website, they have a discord too.

author4,Guess they liked Critical Roll lmao
author2,Seems relevant since John wick 4 just came out
author4,Is a joke in reference to the campaign I run that <@318536129727168512>  is in lol
author18,Make a party of bards to have fun?

author21,"(Google it if you don’t believe that would be funny as hell, then thank me for the dopamine)"
author23,I don’t really have much of a problem with edgelords as long as they aren’t being annoying to the party
author21,"For example, using prestidigitation to make his tasteful all-black attire resemble the Sixth Doctor’s outfit"
author21,You should always cast technically harmless but hilariously annoying spells on the edgelord character(s)
author4,Cast in on the grimdark edgelord rogue for peak comedy
author21,Unless somebody hits you with a remove curse spell

author4,Yoo foundry got spicy
author4,Pov running Gnome Mercy in setting accurate weather
author23,Oh ok
author4,Was explaining for them
author23,But then I heard it was a skeleton
author23,Yeah I know what portable holes are I just thought they have no air
author4,Fair enough lmao
author4,But yeah portable holes you just place it as a pit somewhere
author23,"I was just imagining, well a tiger"
author23,That’s some key information
author4,Its a Bloody Skeleton Dire Tiger
author23,Wait what??
author23,Yeah I just thought that those spaces have no air
author6,It doesn't have lungs
author4,Its basically a Wiley Coyote hole
author23,How does the tiger not suffocate?
author13,I've seen some disgusting ideas for portable holes lol. Don't really know how they work so idk what's memes or nah
author4,"At one point there was a crafting room in the hole
Now he keeps a murder tiger there"
author13,"""Ah yes let me pull all the ingredients in the world out of my inventory"""
author4,+all the bells and whistle belts and stuff for the party
author4,"My crafter/necromancer bard has like a portable hole and a type 4 bag of holding
And he's like lvl 11"
author13,Not used to pathfinder money yet hahaha.
author13,That just sounds so wrong lol
author2,That and 20k isn’t much at high levels
author4,I mean you can waive that by +5ing the DC
author13,"It requires a lot though. And an alchemist player to craft it, it seems."
author4,This is a little wild
author6,Thats human only
author6,Half-elfs do not have a racial trait called skilled
author6,And the best part is this
author6,Why is the half elf racial traits so scuffed on aonprd?
author6,its sooo much
author6,Like look at this shit
author6,I never realised that the shackles lore would be so in depth
author6,Like I am reading about Aroden and this shit is good
author6,Why is pathfinder lore so good?
author4,Cool prestige class
author4,This is a little crazy
author4,Why dont a lot of dinosaurs in pathfinder have tail slaps?
author4,They were porb born july 12 I bet
author4,Oh shit
author7,ive found alt timeline noah
author4,Really good for dex fighters
author4,Fighters finess is a little nuts
author4,Guess I just need to build for a quickened bungle
author4,The racial flags were up on all spells
author4,Well I guess we are just stupid I just checked the spell in the wayback machine
author4,Frankly Im more pissed about this than anything else
author4,Cause guess who doesnt worship Shylen
author6,O no
author4,Tap inner beauty
author4,Guess what other spell is illegal
author5,You can relive the emoji movie every combat
author5,gnome only spell
author4,Cool deivons parry is illegal
author5,Yeah looks like most races have 6ish spells
author5,Tengu also have a bunch of racial spells
author5,I mean sylphs are pretty neat
author4,To pissed off to deal with this rn considering that was literally my favorite spell and I was usually very clutch with it
author4,I might jus grab devon parry idk
author2,That’s fine. Looks like each race has a spell 1-6
author4,And technically this means I cheated in the MMA so
author4,I think my bard is the only one that currently does
author2,Those were probably added at the same time
author4,"Frankly I dont care
Im gonna go be pissed off for an hour then request to swap it on every character that uses it for some utility spell"
author2,Each of the elemental races has a few elemental spells
author2,I mean their are a lot of those spells. Most just go unused.
author4,Just gonna point out that limitation is like saying you have to be an iffrit to cast fireball
author4,In that case I need to start hunting and torturing Sylphs in WotW
author4,"Spell requires a requisite religion or race. If religion, spellcaster must worship the listed deity to utilize the spell. If race, the spell might only target members of the listed race (the spell will say this if it does), but often are just the race's guarded secrets. Members of other races can learn to cast them with GM permission."
author2,Negating crits is pretty powerful
author2,Kinda makes sense
author2,Their goes one of your more used spells
author4,Its sylph only
author2,The latter part?
author4,"<@318536129727168512> 
I was just informed of a quirky detail on windy escape"
author4,Hey <@318536129727168512> can I get a one shot channel for Echos of the North?
author7,<@151489352164311040> one of those says somepony
author2,someone post this in another server
author7,they are simply living their best life
author2,I think I was thinking of cabinet maybe
author2,I was thinking of closet as in like a group of people
author11,It's alright if they deserve it
author4,You guys got 8 people cramed in a like 15x10ft storage closet
author4,Ya'lls closet of people you dislike in gnome
author2,And be open to things other than FAIRY GODPARENTS
author2,Maybe play
author10,maybe allow fun things <a:yawning_peep:939966850266181662>
author11,"New idea, Kitsune (with fox shape, and the tail feats again), soulbound summoner unchained, get the deaf oracle curse so you have constant silent spell and you can use your tail for somatic components, and your eidolon can be an Ancestor so it has the Kitsune change shape racial trait and can appear as human (or a different eidolon subtype and cast alter self on it). Also, take that feat that lets you hide your spell casting with a bluff check. Now you can pretend to be a pet fox, wag your tail to cast a spell then hide it with a bluff check, and even though you're deaf you can still essentially hear because you have the eidolon link ability which is essentially telepathy with your eidolon so it can just tell you what's going on/what's being said"
author11,"Even better, double class campaign like Tristin did and have Vigilante as second class, with tornado bat as vigilante identity"
author11,"interesting you need 13 charisma for fox and bat shape, I figured it'd be wisdom rather than charisma"
author11,i believe
author11,so level 5
author11,and being tiny would offset the need for precise shot until you can get it
author11,so basically you can do all the main stuff once you get three feats
author11,bat shape you can get at first level. Also no it's permanent until you change it just like skinwalker's other forms
author11,oh wait no
author4,or is it the change shape monster ability
author4,Is bat shape rounds?
author11,Lmao I think you have to have +5 bab before you can even take bat shape
author4,I was just asking how long it would take before you even got to do that
author4,Yeah I wasn't shiting on it
author4,Yeah was gonna say lmao
author4,~~Precise shot~~
author11,other than just precise shot and stuff like that
author11,also gives you something to do with your feats
author11,"oh idk it's just more fun, makes you more evasive, stealthy, etc."
author4,It seems like a pretty average Kineticist build
author4,What level would that come online though
author4,Hold person shuffle
author11,"tornado bat would have crazy AC though, tiny, plus high dex, plus being able to be hella far away with air's reach and the defensive talent making most ranged attacks miss"
author4,Or the red dragon's maximized fireball
author4,(and by the dracolich I just mean those in general)
author4,Since now you cant dispell the dracolich's animate dead every round
author11,That had occurred to me
author4,Also you've just made Dragons way fucking scarier
author11,oh no...
author4,Whos ready for a druid who morphed into a fly and is about to cast Finger of Death on the party several times before you even notice him
author11,Or telekinetic fox
author11,Who’s ready for tornado bat
author4,This is also very toxic
author4,"Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled."
author4,I'll be damned I thought they just lost the material parts
author11,So no verbal or somatic
author11,"It says they’re typically spell like, but spell-like abilities don’t have components"
author4,"Spell-likes are spells
They get those as (Su)s?"
author11,"You can do that as a kineticist but it’s not considered a spell. Also sí, I like fox shape/bat shape with a psychic caster"
author4,Natural Spell is a sick feat for a druid btw
author4,"Okay you said summon so I thought you were casting control weather, summon elemental, etc"
author11,"? Kineticist don’t cast as far as I’m aware, I mean the kinetic invocation feat is kinda casting but it works like psychic magic and uses thought and emotion components"
author4,Are you shooting blasts or casting?
author11,Kineticist only need a free prehensile appendage
author4,Still have the verbal component issue though
author4,I thought grasping tail required the tiefling trait
author4,I suppose that would work then
author11,I guess it could
author11,Werebat-kin don’t have a tail initially
author11,"Hmm grasping tail says you just have a tail not that you always have to have a tail, so in bat form I’d have a tail and that tail ends up being prehensile"
author4,Since you are now a bat
author4,Put when you use beast shape you no longer have said tail
author4,Yeah it lets you do somantic with it
author11,That’s what mishevious and grasping tail do
author4,Yeah but it isnt your prehensile one
author11,"Kineticist just need a free hand, also bat has tail"
author4,"So it'd prob be more efficent to grab silent spell and still spell
Or cast through familiar"
author4,+ cant cast verbal
author4,pretty sure you lose your tail in beast shape
author11,Por que
author11,It says it otherwise functions as beastshape 2 so I’m not sure
author4,Does batshape work as polymorph?
author11,"Be a werebat-kin, take bat shape to turn into a tiny bat, take mischievous and grasping tail so you tail counts as a hand for all purpose, and finally become an air kineticist so you can be a tiny bat who summons lightning and hurricanes with your tail"
author7,i know what that is thanks to you

author6,i have found a difference
author4,Yeah I wasnt sure if there were minor differences
author6,They should basically be
author4,Hey are the wizard and sorcerer spell lists identical
author4,Thats quirkier than Aasimar
author2,Neither do hobgoblins
author4,Do Aasimars not have a racial penalty?
author2,How’s it going Connor
author4,Busts out the bluff healer
author6,"get melee fighter
teamwork feat fighter

healer fighter"
author6,everyone is just a fighter
author6,"ok hear me out
fighter one shot"
author4,They just finish doing the deed and their face drops
author5,as you do
author4,I like how Aasimars can get detect Pregnancy as a alt racial trait
author4,Boncing Persistent Bestow curse makes me feel a certain kind of way
author4,Bouncing spell a little quirky
author4,"I like the line in the clay of the concealed companion that says

author4,||Not if I'm the DM||
author7,||atleast you'll get +1 to all your stats||
author4,I feel called out
author4,The overcoming their weaknesses thing
author4,That's what makes a Gnome Bloodrager cooler than a Half-Orc or Human one
author2,I know sometimes it’s like “oh I wish this race had stats better suited for my build” but that kinda gives you a fun challenge to work around
author2,I think the fact that there are some restrictions is what makes games like this fun
author6,im not sure
author6,Good question
author4,Or is it +2 to any single
author4,Is it +2 to 2 minus 2 to any?
author4,"But I mean
A literal fucking cat on average will be more nimble than a fucking dwarf"
author7,But I mean hey
author7,I was thinking either to make the game more fun or it could be like hey your ancestors are this so maybe this trait carried down to you
author7,I see
author6,"Because “We really wanted to reinforce that all of the game’s races are just as flexible as humans when it comes to the range of culture and personality,”"
author7,I don't really understand why they'd do it but you know
author6,ye you can chose any
author7,"I mean
I can't say I'd complain about having more options"
author6,to make it more understandable
author7,You can choose any?
author7,I see you changed your original message

author7,Did they replace it?

author2,Also Saturday
author2,Would do Friday but I’m working
author6,aw we doing this
author2,Mabe kingmaker
author2,We can work on <@&868889886839689217> tomorrow then
author10,i never tried to drag it up before
author7,Randall's dub
author10,figured something out
author10,oh shit nvm
author7,I saw 5 so assumed it was weekdays
author7,Could have atleast told us what those days were
author10,its really not easy to send the entire schedule
author2,How tf we supposed to know
author7,Why the fuck didn't you send the days then as well
author10,because my friday is like empty
author10,the last one is thursday btw <@!318536129727168512>
author6,should be good
author10,just a little bit
author2,So you’ll be a bit late
author7,So your free tomorrow
author2,<@&828644223095275611> tomorrow?
author5,I approve
author4,Brain man
author7,It's why we're doing a test
author7,"Wait so gestalt, homebrew, oh wait nvm
I remembered the answer to my question"
author4,No a monks ass only crits 5% of the time
author6,theres a 9% monkass
author10,on a d100 there is an 11 percent chance to roll between 90-100
author4,"I always forget how cracked this is
Shield of Blades (Ex) (Ultimate Intrigue pg. 16): The vigilante’s wild attacks allow him to block his foes’ counterattacks. He gains Power Attack as a bonus feat. If he already has the Power Attack feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose Power Attack. When he takes an attack or full attack action, if he uses Power Attack on every attack to make melee attacks that use his Strength bonus on attack rolls, he gains a shield bonus to his AC until his next turn equal to his penalty on attack rolls from Power Attack. This bonus applies only if he actually takes that penalty on at least one of the attack rolls."
author2,That could be improved two weapon defense
author2,It could also be a thing where you forgo an offhand attack and get a +2 for each one
author2,It is worse version of vigilante talent
author4,Like dodge is just better in both the bonus type and the prereqs
author4,It's kinda just a bad feat
author2,Nah. To small of an improvement to be a tree.
author4,And it only works following a full round
author4,Maybe improved two weapon defense?
author2,Maybe dodge or combat reflexes
author2,I would put an extra pre req on it in that case. It would be a bit too good. Semi-undermining a sword and board build
author4,The normal feat has no reason for you to take it over dodge
author4,Because the idea is that it's hard to hit through your flurry of blades
author4,Cap at +3 ac with gtwf
author2,Something like +1 for each of the main ones
author4,Yknow Two-weapon defense would be good if it scaled with the feat tree
author7,I am
author5,<@!146626274066956288> you as well
author5,also look in kingmaker for summary
author5,a couple minutes ago

author7,How is pizza gonna work
author5,https://youtu.be/87F-Ind9BaQ this is great

author5,Also I have dice for myself
author7,you know tin in valheim
author6,are you ton or ten
author5,I actually have a coworker named tristan
author5,my coworker
author7,who the fuck is tristan
author4,Tj had the quick draw
author6,so tristan gets green and randall gets to make dice out of the pizza box
author5,Randall got last on initiative he receives green
author5,"Blue, Green, Red, and Purple"
author5,I have 4 sets of dice for everyone
author7,an idea has spawned
author7,boys *and* girls
author7,ladies and gentleman
author7,he has an idea
author6,i have an idea
author7,but indeed...
author5,"Yes, but..."
author7,invasion of privacy bad but....
author5,It would be quirky
author7,That would be bad
author5,what if I could just move you into a call without you already being in one
author10,i refuse
author10,i see
author2,Hey <@146626274066956288> join general real quick
author10,bruh veggies on pizza are pog
author5,We can decide when we are there but mostlikely a meatlovers and a cheese of some sort if we get 2 and then either we order some cinnamon sticks or some shit or Lawrence provides for TJ
author4,"I'm fine with anything that has no veggies, mushrooms, fish, or a weird sauce"
author10,pizza hut stuffed crust 🤤
author7,i vote anything with a lot of meat
author10,we can just get pizza hut to deliver
author10,or cheese
author10,or sausage
author10,like can we get supreme
author7,randall asked what type of pizza
author2,So pizza sound good to everyone (except TJ)
author4,Sounds like a plan
author6,im gonna try to be there at 1215
author4,My address is 1082 Jonathan Creek Rd. just ping me with a time whenever you figure out your routing
author6,im down
author4,"Makes sense
If you are willing to come get me that's fine by me"
author6,I live on main st
author4,"I'm at the entrance to Jcreek if that changes anything
Dunno where you live either"
author6,and prob tristan
author6,i could get you
author4,Can I get a lift or do I need to figure something else out
author4,2nd thing I have no car + my mom will be at work so I can't get her to bring me
author6,Alan's creek
author4,"Okay so a couple small things
Where tf does Lawrence live"
author5,order piiza
author10,<@!151500793990742016> feed us
author10,so i can but itll be tight
author4,I mean all you need is 1 cargo crate
author5,Tell them you have other plans
author7,"randall ""thats not how that works"""
author5,take them early
author4,Send them straight to Brazil
author4,Just abduct them
author4,So in theory
author10,then i guess ill miss
author5,Well we can't really do it anyother time
author10,have to take them places
author10,siblings have been dumped on me
author5,<@&828644223095275611> So it looks like we are doing monday at Lawrences house. Be there at 12:30 and start at 1:00 be out of there around 5 probably. Make sure with whoever you need to that you can be there.
author7,Rip I guess
author2,The slam would actually do 1d3
author2,They would both just do 1 damage
author2,<@151489352164311040> those claws and slams would do less damage cause of size
author6,also i can give it 5 foot reach for some reason
author4,18-20 crit range
author6,are you ready to be whipped by a spider
author4,Rapier is the move
author6,give it a whip then
author4,Without other feats that is
author4,You can't finess a spear
author6,did i mention it has 23 ac
author6,because it already has weapon finesse
author6,or i could give it a spear
author6,and it has 21 dex
author6,so in theory i could give a spider and a bow
author4,Get on it's level
author4,Lich newt does 1d2-4
author6,why does a king crab deal 1d2-2 damage
author6,and it also makes the familiar respawn
author4,I see
author6,"im looking at a familiar archtype that lets you take 
 evolutions"
author6,cockroach but animals do not approch it
author6,cockroach but with simple weapon proficency
author6,cockroach but it can cast magic missle
author6,cockroach but it can smite good
author6,cockroach with 4 1d4 claw attacks
author6,cockroach that does 1d8 slam damage
author6,ok so
author7,and wednesday ill be gone during school hours for a pack leader team building thing at lake logan with 9th graders
author7,tuesday i have to get a shot at 1:30
author7,but basically
author7,will have to confirm tomorow tho
author7,most likely
author2,Sound good <@!151500793990742016>
author10,less people in it
author10,less hassle
author10,i would honestly prefer laws house
author4,Honestly I'm indifferent
author2,We can vote
author2,We can do yours too
author7,Damn I start talking bout my house and tristin be like ^
author2,If it’s good with his parents I guess
author2,I concede we can do it at Ranballs house
author7,We could also do it outside if tristin wants to bring a foldable table but
author7,*don't have decent sized tables
author7,So yeah
author7,I have a big dinner table we never use
author7,I was bouta say I don't have tables but
author10,law does too
author7,Randall does
author10,tristin is just bein anti randall house
author10,i do
author4,That is true but no one really has a home that makes it feasible
author10,public and outside are not good for board games
author4,Honestly I thought park would be best
author4,"Who vetoed the park
Randall?"
author5,I'd also prefer not to do it at my house
author5,"TJ house, community college, fast food, park I guess"
author4,What has been ruled out
author5,Most suggestions are welcome
author5,<@&828644223095275611> we need to find out a different spot for in person because the college closes at 4pm and that is no bueno
author4,I also like how a lucky stone is more expensive than the horseshoe but it's worse
author4,Because it isn't exactly a spell effect so I'm thinking it's a no
author4,Also I need to ask Tristin if I can use moly on the check
author4,I see
author6,i think the lowest i rolled was a 21
author4,Dusty rose cracked prism is cheap as hell
author4,This one was the meta
author4,What did you roll on your saves?
author6,i feel better fighting a gnome in my sleep
author4,But I goyta hedge my bets first
author4,I would like to
author6,idk maybe you do it
author4,We need to force Randall to meditate somehow
author6,+18 fort save time?
author4,The +4 is the funny part
author6,this item is for me
author6,"As long as a lucky horseshoe’s owner carries it on her person, she gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws"
author4,"Just gonna post some quirky items here
https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Wayfinder%20of%20Hidden%20Strength"
author7,"Basically I got on call with mom, she wanted me to cut grass at daycare which I then said what if I just did that on the weekend.
While on phone I sat in couch and put feet up in moms room.
Started falling asleep on phone call.
I went to sleep after phone call."
author4,*and social anxiety*
author5,Thats just immunity to fear for 2k
author4,This is a funny item
author2,Probably next Tuesday
author2,We need to discern a place to do in person
author5,The slight curve he does at the bottom of the second line on that square bothers me
author5,Will get you cinnamon sticks or some shit TJ
author6,i guess
author5,Everyone willing to pitch in like $5 for a pizza fund
author7,Also I'm having to go to asheville with mother
author7,I leave sometime next year hopefully
author4,I leave 14th or 15th
author6,i leave on the 17th
author6,I would be down
author5,<@&828644223095275611> you guys still wan't to do something in person before school starts?
author2,Spine destroyer
author5,gestalt characters start with 5k
author5,https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Downtime&Category=Gamemastering a lot of interesting stuff
author4,Either bard gunslinger or bard swash
author5,It'll be better to test with a balanced party
author4,Also are we just gonna tell people our test character ideas?
author4,Got it
author4,Would the wisdom check be changed as well?
author4,Said umd since there is mishap related stuff in there too
author5,Yes this will probably be replaced with the wild magic table
author4,"Starts with ""if the user meets""
https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Scrolls&Category=Magic%20Items"
author5,can you send a link to the scroll rules cause I can't find them
author4,Nat 1ing anything else just means it doesn't like you for 24hrs
author4,The mishaps are a scroll thing fyi if you are looking for it
author5,I have to make it first
author4,Just replace mishap table or?
author4,Also how will umd mishaps work in relation to this
author4,Got it
author5,like I said homebrew
author4,So casting will only fuck up on a 1
author5,basically nat 1 rules for spells
author5,wild magic basically makes it so if you fuck up a spell random shit happens
author4,Half orc lookin kinda sexy
author6,so how does wild magic work?
author5,and the other feats
author4,So the special version of endurance is available
author5,Those just expand your pool
author4,But norm barb/b-rager/skald con boost wouldn't
author5,So you have a buffer
author5,Temp hp doesn't effect wounds
author4,Also how does uc barb temp hp work with wounds
author5,That plus endurance would cancel it out completely
author4,Would you let the magical knack trait counter the cl drops? https://aonprd.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Magical%20Knack
author5,We will also be using wound thresholds as well as a homebrew wildmagic system
author5,Just so everyone knows the gestalt AP stats will be 20 point buy same for the test. The AP will start at level 1 and the test will be at level 4 if you want to start working on characters.
author4,I would like to kill the trent and maybe the tiger soon in wotw
author4,Sounds good to me
author5,Plan is that we will do the last part of varnhold on wednesday in kingmaker and on thursday we will do wotw cause it hasn't been played in a bit.
author2,Btw we gonna have to do earlier time on Wednesday
author2,Doesn’t mean evil character is illegal though
author2,It’ll probably be more fun being good/neutral
author4,Good swag
author10,being evil poopy
author7,I'm down for evil
author10,ill pass
author10,im good
author5,you guys could be evil in the gestalt ap if you were so inclined
author6,sounds like covid
author2,"So traps, plague, other dimensions, and situational allies"
author2,That one is interesting
author4,Situational allies
author6,so its a plaque plague
author7,"i was really tempted to just fucking say square or circle
then i started thinking the word simple and simple machines came to mind"
author10,preferably the first world
author10,different dimensions
author2,So traps. Gotcha
author7,simple machines
author2,So what other words
author2,And false is no
author2,Cause cliques already exist in the form of guild and kingdoms
author2,Nah to both
author7,you dont want the whole gestalt ap to be a dream?
author2,Aight so nah
author2,The hell either of those mean
author7,abstract or cliques
author2,Aight <@&828644223095275611> hit me up with another word for the gestalt ap
author4,Got it
author5,<@&828644223095275611> I got family stuff I gotta go to and Randall feels sick so we are going to cancel for today
author10,bed cozy zzzzzz
author4,And make Tmnt
author4,As ninjas
author4,Everyone runs shellens
author4,In that case hear me out
author6,don't steal my ideas
author4,My time has come
author4,God now I have to make a monk with that
author4,But it's funnier to be like and yeah he dicked the dragon
author4,I mean the obvious answer to any question like this is polymorph
author4,Guess it's the same reason you can get that sick giant ancestry
author4,Dumptruck ass
author4,"An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds."
author6,I like to think that its body temperature is dangerously high
author4,That are unfortunately not made of fire
author4,Okay it's a specific type of fire elemental
author2,And not all elemental fire creatures are just straight fire
author2,I think it is more of a curse situation
author4,And said yeah let me put my dick im that
author4,A human looked at a floating mass of fire
author4,Which implies that at some point
author4,Are crosses between fire elementals and humans
author4,Wait so ifrits
author4,On another note here is a cursed race from 2e https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=42
author4,Fyi there is a turtle race in dnd if you need a base
author4,Tmnt time
author6,i was so confused
author6,not being turtles
author6,i thought we were racing turtles
author6,different race
author2,There speed is but they still have decent reflexes
author4,But turtle slow
author2,Prob gonna be con wis -int and then an alternate that is dex wis -int
author4,What are they gonna be Con Wis -Dex
author10,that is laws race
author10,give it to law
author6,so thats the pursuit
author5,I think I'm gonna introduce a turtle race in the homebrew
author10,i want to do history
author6,imagine having to do any history
author10,they sound amazing
author10,but deadass hyped for those classes
author10,gotta do gen ed stuff
author7,"randall wit da history and civilization
finna be a history teacher"
author6,ignore the fact i literally have the same thing
author10,chem in between *
author10,which is short
author10,i only have chem on those days
author10,i can take a nap in between
author6,on the same day
author6,8am classes and 9 pm classes
author10,just gotta have the hours
author10,its not too bad really
author2,How so?
author10,i do but its funky
author2,<@146626274066956288> do you have a schedule yet?
author4,My turn takes 8 of those lol
author2,For everyone just remember in the future you have 5-10 minutes to thinking about what you’re going to do before your turn.
author4,And that's kind of on all my characters
author4,"Yeah for me it's always I could buff, debuff, move to tank, move to flank, fullround/attack, use an alchemical item to finess something"
author10,what else do?
author10,someone die
author10,i punch
author4,I try to be quick but also I always like trying to make strategic moves
author10,what else would i do
author2,Randall is probably the quickest in combat. But that is mostly because he for the most part does the same thing on most turns.
author4,Ie we act like dumpasses
author5,Imma hop in the bath to alleviate before I try and join a call
author4,"I feel like sometimes that's on me
But also sometimes we get in a social encounter where nothing happens"
author5,what you guys do in 2 days could get done in 1
author5,if we can get combat going
author5,But yeah
author5,We should probably start shifting to whatever will be best before it happens hnestly
author5,and weekend I assume TJ
author4,Technically i could either sleep asap after calc or mid day
author6,friday off
author6,its a bit funky
author6,this is my schedule
author5,Also me and law should have normal highschool times so
author5,One other main point is you can choose not to pay attention in social encounters that is up to you. But in combat I would like to not have to explain what is happening and for you guys to be ready for your turn. That would make combat 2-3 times faster and we would be able to finish these books a lot faster.
author10,my classes gonna be funky
author4,I'm also morning class
author4,Depends on day
author6,i think you mean late night class
author4,That sucks I'm mr late afternoon class
author7,But at the same time how much i pay attention in total leaves a little to be desired
author10,since stories are pog
author6,Also when school starts up im busy till 4-7 pm on monday/wednesday and im busy from like 630 to 10 pm on thursday
author10,and i do want to finish an ap
author7,I have more fun than i let on
author10,its fun
author10,i want to keep doing it
author5,I'm totally fine with you guys putting stuff over pathfinder. I don't expect you to care about it as much as I do. I would just prefer to know when you won't be there
author4,The thing about times is that school will eventually start back up
author7,"For not saying anything i just suck for like i shouldnt do that, but i still put gym over pathfinder (tho i havent gone in like a month)"
author5,I'm totally fine doing different times
author10,the gym was sorta a dick move
author4,On a similar note we might want to redefine our session times
author5,If anything I would just like for you guys to let me know if you have something coming up so I can cancel or reschedule the game instead of sitting there for 2 hours to eventually say it is too late
author10,at least you know that
author7,"That is fair, i do suck for that"
author5,My problem is when you and J plan on going to the gym and you don't tell me until the game has started and we are asking where you are
author10,noah got da tj typing speed
author5,I'm totally fine when it comes to your mom giving you stuff to do
author7,"in the case of my mom there is nothing i can do
it does not matter to her"
author10,go to store
author4,Mow grass
author10,randall taking a nap
author7,x chore
author4,"So personally, my stance is this
Tristin puts a lot of effort into running 2 seperate Pathfinder games for us, the least everyone could do is come prepared at the agreed upon time(s). On the other hand Tristin should probably make sure he is not overexerting himself and spending all his freetime on Pathfinder. (And I say this as someone who spends a lot of time on Pathfinder) One thing I would like to note that the reason Tristin started making games run more frequently is likely because absences were so common. But as they became more frequent they have been prioritized less.
Also there are times when reasons for missing are reasonable *but* it could have been resolved earlier and kept the commitment intact (Me leaving for Lowes mid-session, Lawrence doing x chore) but these things still need to get done."
author7,"im waiting for him to like cut a big paragraph
say ""get good""
then actually paste what he had typed"
author6,"he's just gonna say ""OK"""
author7,Thesis statement
author5,It will either be a paragraph or a sentence
author7,Im waiting for noahs input
author5,Also I'm totally fine with it if I know ahead of time. AKA more than an hour before the game starts
author10,<@!458413180893397022> type faster
author10,yeah makes sense
author10,oh right tj
author5,That is still late and TJ had overwatch
author10,we had time
author10,we got back at like 6:30 lol
author10,wait is that why we didn't do it?
author5,Such as today. I didn't have any problem with skipping cause you guys wanted to go get food.
author5,Not even good reason just decent reason
author5,and it does genuinely stress me out a lot especially if my time is wasted. I'm not trying to paint Lawrence as the bad guy. Everyone does it. Including outside of pathfinder. There are times when I can't show up either. I just have a problem when it isn't a good reason. Because then it feels like it doesn't matter to you guys at all and I feel like whats the point and start questioning whether or not you guys even enjoy playing.
author5,That is just how I personally view it as a commitment
author5,So if I say hey lets do pathfinder thursday a week ahead of time I;m gonna prioritize it over something that came up that day
author5,"I'm not trying to guilt trip. But I do put a lot of work into this game yes because I have fun with it but also because I know you guys ""want"" to play. If I don't do anything then the game can't run no matter what. I also typically just hold things in higher regard if I've told people I would do them for a longer time."
author6,I fell that law is kinda obligated to at least make an attempt to show up
author10,"and tristin you're kinda just guilt tripping law here. it was your choice to do those things, to put pathfinder so highly"
author10,but should you?
author10,yeah law you can do whatever
author10,neither of you are really correct here ngl
author7,Now I don't know how to respond
author5,Thinking about this is making me feel sick
author5,Such as right now
author5,That is basically an outlet because if I didn't take it out I would have emotional breakdowns at random much more often
author7,Which i figured after you've expressed yourself in the past
author5,It genuinely stresses me out and makes me not mad but upset when you guys don't show up
author5,"The thing is I spend hours prepping for sessions for you guys to play and have even in the past missed out on seeing family I wouldn't see for a while just for you guys to say ""yeah I forgot"" or ""I'm gonna go do something else instead"""
author7,meaning i prolly wouldnt play
author7,Making tristin call me asinine is entertaining
author7,"Which i understand, but in that case, i prolly just wouldnt"
author6,Most dm's wouldn't give you that freedom
author7,"Basically, I know that im just pulling dick moves but at the same time, i have the freedom to be busy and/or ""busy"" elsewhere"
author5,That made me die inside
author5,She said she was surprised people wouldn't show up
author5,7:41 hits the closest to home
author5,but it is painful
author5,Not to be mean
author5,you're the worst for all of those things
author7,"but um, i cant say it'll change much"
author5,Honestly Lawrence you needed that video the most
author5,I know
author7,then u said both
author7,i was just moving it under that message
author5,that one as well
author5,That isn't necessary but it is useful and would probably make you care more about the game
author5,"Main points are Have your shit together x5, show up, pay attention, and exist"
author6,in the library
author6,i need a 5 paragraph description of each book
author6,ima read the library
author7,ask to read every book you come across >:)
author5,and hits very very close to home
author5,about D&D but it all translates
author5,pretty cool video
author4,Just stumbled onto it
author4,Shattered Defenses is a really good feat for sneak attack classes
author4,That's straight a power of friendship punch
author7,Im finna erase you
author4,Like functionally you could just cast it
author4,Why is this so funny to me
author4,"Ultimate Vindication (Ex): At 20th level, if a foe kills one of a vindictive bastard’s allies or knocks the vindictive bastard unconscious (and she later regains consciousness), the vindictive bastard musters a vindictive fury. The next time she hits that foe within 1 minute, the vindictive bastard can channel the effects of a disintegrate spell through her weapon, using her paladin level as her effective caster level. Whether or not the target succeeds at its save against the disintegrate effect, it is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours."
author7,even my first d20 wasnt in the double digits
author10,nobody rolled high here
author12,"<@!151500793990742016>  :game_die:

author5,All males will now have to roll 1d8 for dick size
author4,This is quirky
author4,"Special: If you have 3 or more ranks in Acrobatics, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2, and a +6 dodge bonus to AC when taking the total defense action instead of the usual +4."
author4,Especially when paired with shared ownership
author4,I love that feat
author6,this feat sounds dope
author9,🤮 🤮 🤮
author4,They have a budget phylactery when less than 0 hp
author10,that could be stopped by any of their weaknesses
author10,that would make sense
author10,i think vamps should have regen
author4,But you can't knock them
author10,i thought that was so dumb
author10,put a vampire under running water to kill it
author4,Just pulled up the page yeah budget version
author10,ok so how does regen and fast healing differ
author5,Vampires just have budget version
author5,Kinda but thats the same for things with regeneration
author10,kick a vampire with less than 0 hitpoints repeatedly to keep them dead
author4,I cpuld have sworn on my life they did
author10,can you just
author10,so like
author5,I was just saying that they don't have regeneration like Noah had said
author10,i see now
author10,yeah i did
author5,Randall misunderstood what i said
author10,tristin said so
author4,Where did I say they couldn't
author5,PLot isn't the hard part
author10,also <@!458413180893397022> ur dumb vampires can be killed a couple ways
author5,I got it covered
author10,i think
author10,<@!531348109347782656> if you need help with plot things you can ask in fairly vague terms
author10,yeah sounds about right
author10,do prestige classes not count as multiclass?
author5,I meant no
author10,i guess one of mine is too
author4,mfw one of my characters is already a multiclass
author6,"hear me out
make it into kingmaker 
and our 2 charcters just do a fusion"
author5,I've got a plot line going and it is looking very good
author7,"Si, I am editing a Floorplan"
author2,At work?
author7,I also see that
author2,It sounded like the other way around
author2,I see
author7,That's what I was going for
author2,We got spooky dragon vermin pursuit
author2,Can you join general real quick
author2,Alright TJ
author2,Those could have more of an effect than yours
author7,"I'm out here with big things and you two got
Pursuit and eldritch"
author10,i would help you with the homebrew thing since i love a good story but i dont wanna spoil it for myself
author7,"Or
Huge enemies"
author2,"Alright so, I do not plan on starting the gestalt campaign until at least one or both of the current campaigns are done. That being said. A home brew campaign takes a lot of time to plan. So I would like each of you to give me 1 word (2 if it only makes sense with 2) that I will work into this campaign."
author7,"Uh, I don't mind either but new kingmaker book is enticing"
author10,i want kingmaker
author4,But if everyone is there we might want to start the new book on km
author4,I want to do wotw
author7,I feel like tristin just put in his input of which one he wants
author6,martial arts
author5,<@&828644080443326494> which one tomorrow
author4,Down 200%
author7,Even at the start
author7,I'd be like 10 classes behind what I should be always
author7,As in
author7,"I'd be down but like
My ability to update my character sheet isn't"
author6,why do i feel like tristan is making a build for every 2 class combination
author5,We should totally do a gestalt campaign in the future
author10,character named Four T'nait
author4,Small picture mode neat
author4,It's funny as hell though
author10,Enemy hammer unironicslly doesn't sound bad
author7,Enemy Hammer 😈
author7,You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents or objects.
author7,Enemy Hammer?
author4,I like Enemy Hammer more
author7,"You ever tryna piss outside and a fly lands on your dick?
Fortunately I can't relate"
author6,i spelt basically so bad it thought i said antisocial
author6,baiscially wish is a fucking genie
author4,"Ha ha I wish for infinite wishes
Ok enter the void"
author4,That escalated quickly
author6,"Typically, greedy characters will request more wishes, for example, as one of their wishes. The referee should then put that character into an endless closed time loop"
author4,Meant wasn't
author4,It also was present in the original DnD
author4,They removed it in ADnD2e
author4,It was ADnD1e
author4,But that might be a different edition
author4,Can't remember but I think male characters got a Str bonus while female got Cha bonus
author6,i dont follow
author6,like elf and hobbit can be 4th level fighters and dwarf can be 6th level while a human can be 11th level
author4,Also isn't it sexist too
author4,Oh misread it
author6,other races do though
author6,nah humans dont have a limit to their amount of levels
author4,But only 8 levels?
author6,"only humans could be clerics 
like no other race can be clerics"
author4,Wait I thought they could be clerics
author4,Selfish bastards
author4,Humans only take
author6,and if your not a human you limeted to like a max of about 8 levels in classes that aren't thief
author4,That's hella quirky
author6,also 1e is really racist and only lets humans be clerics
author4,No one had defined the concept of a mana pool so wizards could just do that
author4,Yeah I did know that actually
author6,also if you have 17 int your spells known is unlimited
author4,Necromancy is ***MANDATORY***
author6,like uh
author6,also for some reason the class name changes every level
author4,The local Necromancer
author6,the corpse store
author4,Where tf do you buy corpses
author4,Theives are og Rogue right
author6,human bodys are expensive
author6,"but did you know Thieves of the 3rd and above are able to read most (80%) languages, so treasure maps can be read and understood by them without recourse to a spell."
author6,thats sad
author4,Including Pathfinder 2e
author4,From what I can tell most games have that stipulation
author7,: (
author4,Like mf why can I not sneak attack with a bat
author4,"That you can't sneak attack with weapons that aren't ""finesse"" or ""agile"""
author4,You know what iritates me irrational about most tabletop games I've skimed the rules on
author4,I swear on my life the original message just said dnd
author4,So 1e?
author6,"what im reading is the ""original rules"""
author4,Which version
author6,"Elves can begin as either fighters or magic-users and may freely switch class between campaigns (they may also be thieves). They gain benefits from both classes and may use both weaponry and spells. They may use magic armor and still act as magic-users. However, they may not progress beyond 4th level fighter or 8th level magic-user."
author6,dnd 1e is fucky
author5,The archetype stuff makes it so it can be basically any str based martial
author4,Champion looks like Cavalier + Paladin
author5,Champion can get all the paladin abilities though
author4,Only the *Champion*
author4,My face when 2e has no Paladin class
author6,honestly i prob should have done this in <#840007664506503168>
author4,Make a channel for this
author4,I saw that earlier actually
author5,https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wizard%20Hook If anyone feels like losing a hand this is pretty fucking good.
author4,Didn't realize you could do that
author4,That's actually really cool
author2,Last paragraph
author5,He gotta cut grass in front of daycare
author12,"Valenkryst: ""<@!151500793990742016> where are you??!!"""
author4,What time
author7,I ended up going to asheville at 12 and just got back so I'll prolly be good
author4,So I'm home
author5,Lawrence can't make it so if Noah can we will if not we'll just skip. Probably doing kingmaker. Gonna want everyone for way of the wicked. If we do do it.
author4,On how fast I walk
author2,<@&828644223095275611> <@&828644080443326494> maybe today 🤔
author4,The dual balanced weapon mod is interesting
author7,Waiting on rice to finish
author7,Having to make dinner
author7,Be there in a few
author2,Aight we going without <@146626274066956288>
author7,I'm afraid that does not suffice
author7,There are a select few correct answers <@146626274066956288>
author7,Final boss
author2,Nah. With Lawrence. Only reason he’d ever say that.
author4,"Pretty sure Tristin's at work
But don't quote me on that"
author7,Oh nvm
author7,Was this the bad idea <@318536129727168512>
author6,so does pathfinder exist today?
author4,Mistmail may be good for Lawrence
author4,For anyone
author4,Also Boots of Springing and Striding are generally useful
author4,Seems useful
author4,I would like to acquire a stash of Barbarian chew
author7,"Allergy medicine consumed, omw home"
author7,I have to run to Walmart and then grab some nourishment
author7,Do we have Pathfinder today
author5,What are referring to? Did you do that when you GMd?
author26,"Hey, I know this move"
author2,He hasn’t done anything. Yet.
author4,What did he do this time I mean?
author2,And I’m not gonna stop the campaign because of it like last time
author2,I’m tired of it
author2,<@&828644223095275611> <@&828644080443326494> Lawrence gets 3 more strikes
author7,I do but
author10,really gotta fix those fixins law
author5,<@456226577798135808> after graduating
author27,Fuck off mate
author4,But why are you popping off to getting nerfed
author27,@stfu i dont have the server muted
author5,I cannot believe <@456226577798135808> would do this
author27,I didnt know where else🙄
author5,<@456226577798135808> kinda sus
author5,I was condused cause <@456226577798135808> didn't use <#842138493932666940>
author5,I'm guessing yes
author4,<@456226577798135808> Poppin off to getting nerfed
author5,Are you referring to the announcement?
author27,Yay thank god
author7,: )
author12,"Gamemaster: ""<@!151500793990742016> where are you??!!"""
author7,i gotchu
author4,My shift key is a little sticky on my laptop
author4,That's a threat
author4,Yeah lube up
author7,i think you meant lubehole
author4,but not a loophole
author4,That is true
author7,4 having been at hec
author4,But imagine not graduating in 4 years
author7,a Man? more like CEO of not being 18
author4,Yeah I am now ***MAN***
author7,did graduation make you a different person?
author7,have you changed noah?
author4,I was subjected to change
author5,also wasn't planning on it cause of this
author5,We can just try and do a extra session wednesday
author4,"Do we want to try and to a session or something tomorrow?
Since we missed Thursday and Friday"
author4,But that is subject to change
author4,And probably can't do anything this weekend because of relatives
author4,Graduation stuff
author4,Also Friday is a no go for me
author4,Also its !gym
author4,"I think between me, TJ, and the Oracle we can do WotW recon"
author6,there is a decent chance lawrence will be at the gym
author5,Randall has to leave at 5:30
author4,Who all can't make it
author5,Looks like it is a no go on doing a full on game today. Can maybe still do wotw if you don't plan on starting the castle assault or kingdom buillding
author10,Parents are making me go to academic awards but I'll show up when I can tonight
author4,Reminds me of the collectors edition nameplate
author2,Oh shit
author4,Since main group is dead
author4,I see you added the dash delta bot
author6,it went down?
author7,<@151489352164311040> <@235883733985525760>
author5,@everyone 10 min
author10,i wanna do kingmaker tonight
author5,Which one you guys want to do? and will do the other tommorow
author10,which one we doin
author5,really is
author5,@everyone tonight
author5,Btw if you want with the wrestling thing two people could make level 6 characters that work together
author5,mainly for rogues who can't reach the 13 str pre req for power attack
author5,that exists
author4,Especially considering the grace feats need a free hand
author5,for most dex classes it would be better than power attack
author4,I still think that the feat is better for a lot of dex based classes
author5,furious focus
author4,Hit different
author4,Well yeah but barbarians just
author5,reckless rage feat
author5,I mean
author4,I was thinking better for rogue ngl
author5,I mean you would be full bab if the dmg bonus is that high at lvl 4
author4,Yeah but a not full bab class can really be hurting with the lower attack
author5,+10 damage at lvl 4
author4,But it's aimed at rouges anyway
author4,That's true
author5,also why not use both
author5,doesn't get better with two handing though
author4,AC penalty instead of attack
author4,Theres a halfling only feat that is power attack but better
author4,"But I still think this might be better
Grazed: -1 to skills
Wounded -1 to attack, skills, saves, checks, and AC
Critical: -2 to all +caster lvl"
author4,That is true
author5,The same applies to the enimies
author4,I'm just saying on my slayer 1 hit might knock me to half health and then I'm taking -2s to everything
author5,I dont feel like endurance is a must have. If anything i feel like it is a good change cause it makes endurance useful
author4,I'd just have to build for it
author4,Seems like a fun concept
author4,So maybe just do that at critical?
author4,Also the caster level thing neuters non Con based magus builds
author4,Would be better
author4,With grazed only affecting skill checks
author4,I think if the attack penalties only started at wounded and critical
author4,+The modified Endurance feat becomes a must have
author4,The thing is it really hurts melee martials and prefers certain types of healers
author4,But not sure I'd want to run it in an ongoing game
author4,I like it as a concept
author5,<@!151489352164311040> I'm only talking about the wounded rules
author5,and pretty simple to understand
author5,not that much reading
author6,cosmic allignment
author6,a lot of reading
author5,What are you guys thoughts on using this system?
author7,I understand
author6,anime is different on the big screen in the dark
author5,I made a second character
author4,Is the reroll before or after the effect is known
author5,The winner of the tournament gets a free reroll in kingmaker and wotw
author5,"Lvl 8 25 point buy 33,000 gp"
author4,Oh he Dmed and I also thought he meant irl
author5,and yes that is a threat
author5,Then I'll just have to work them into the game.
author10,no i dont
author5,Basically I got a character idea I want to test
author6,ya know it
author7,Of you
author5,we each make wrestling characters and do a tournament
author7,Thought you were talking irl for a second
author5,Anyone wanna have a wrestling tournament?
author7,"i saw closed s day, my brain edited out the un so i skipped over that sig"
author7,i see was correct
author7,which is why i assumed you tried to go inside
author7,i saw
author7,i see
author25,Top sign on door
author7,you sent a picurte of the door
author25,You do realize I didnt try to go into the lobby right
author7,tho that was back after we split when us three were biking
author7,last time tristin and i went they're lobby was closed
author7,i should have said that
author6,hear me out a halfling witch with a permanent reduce size and it has  a familiar with a permanent increase size so they can ride their familiar
author6,wait so in way of the wicked can noah mount me
author4,"Found something interesting on the combat maneuver rule page:
""Unless otherwise noted, performing a combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of the maneuver. If you are hit by the target, you take the damage normally and apply that amount as a penalty to the attack roll to perform the maneuver."""
author7,Didn't tj choose one
author5,<@!151500793990742016> ^
author5,Would you like to choose another
author5,Already did that one
author7,I was yelling you to do the first one
author5,TJ decided
author5,no u
author5,<@!151500793990742016> ^
author5,Law which anime next
author7,"It took me a second but I looked at the word Roman a couple times, physically held up 2 fingers then got it"
author5,kinda sug
author5,<@!458413180893397022> can only use it once per day though
author5,My brain didn't even consider Roman numerals
author5,I had to look that one up
author4,Barbarians can get big with the Abyssal bloodline rage power
author10,<@318536129727168512> <@531348109347782656> this matters to you

author7,<@!151489352164311040> randall requets i get your attention once more ^
author10,we had the exact same dev btw
author7,<@!151489352164311040> valenkryst wants your attention ^
author4,They really buffed Knights in Chess 2
author7,"Technically I cheated cuz I put multiple games in one box, but they were of the same genre/series so"
author5,technically not totally first person
author5,It was like the funnest alternative first person shooter I've ever played
author7,Death was fun but not one of my favorites
author10,<@151500793990742016> what if w101 again
author7,never got membership when i first played them but poured a lot of time into the areas i could explore
author7,same for wizard 101
author7,but i still poured too much time into it
author7,neither did i
author10,But I never got a membership
author10,Jumpstart was fun
author7,"o shit, ive remembered two random mmo's that i dumped part of my childhood into
JumpStart and another i cant remember the name of"
author7,honestly i could swap club penguin out for roblox
author7,same for cuphead

author7,i wouldnt put it on there
author7,he beat me but...
author7,then tristin and i had a race over a couple days to see who could get to the end first
author7,postkinghts on mobile was pretty fun
author7,"personally i dont look at it like that, but, with that in mind i would put minecraft and terraria in the same square"
author4,"You ever grind Jetpack Joyride, Subway Surfers, or another mobile game"
author6,you need variety in a 3x3 and terraria and minecraft are fairly close to being the same game
author7,like i might just leave that last square empty
author7,"but idk
idk why i say idk but idk"
author7,that was on my mind
author4,Math Cool 😦
author7,cool math can go in the 10th square for honorary mentions
author4,Cool Math

author2,It’s 5:30 already
author2,Or “what would be good for this?”
author2,Just me going “hey what do you think about this?”
author10,<@!531348109347782656> what does helping entail
author2,I’m probably gonna start work on home brew at 5 anyone who wants can help
author4,Yeah sure
author6,sure but leave at 8
author5,@everyone down for tonight?
author4,The only thing that I wasn't already gonna get was the ranks in knowledge arcana
author4,But yeah maybe a 1-3 lvl dip in this would be neat on the Bard
author4,Take 10 on UMD is also sick
author5,scroll master
author4,So I can find this later
author7,: (
author7,i enjoy seeing how my idea played into that sentence
author5,So what I've got so far is you guys are all goblins who everyone hate because you were all falsely accused of rape and you guys have to get people to like you so you can kill a giant wizard god so you can use his money to repay your crippling debt.
author4,"Goblin campaign, enough said"
author4,Campaign to repay debt after accidentally destroying a Sun Orchid Elixir
author5,<@!458413180893397022> <@!151500793990742016> feed me ideas
author7,"I won't disagree, but it's because I hadn't seen the rest of the message yet
This was in reference to what Noah said just so u kno"
author5,Don't defend Randall's stupid
author4,I thought the same at first glance
author7,"I'm assuming he saw you say not gonna run it, referring to the AP ideas, and thought you were talking about one of our current ones"
author7,Did Randall get learned
author5,Join main voice cause your ass making no since
author10,right now?
author5,whats your damage
author5,what you mean
author10,which one do you not want to run
author5,I want to make an AP

author10,<@!318536129727168512> <@!531348109347782656> ?
author5,@everyone so basically I'm probably not gonna run it (anytime soon anyways) but can each of you DM me what you think would be a fun AP idea.
author10,Be there in 10
author2,@everyone imma go ahead and hop in the call
author2,Randall gets off at 4
author6,not sure which though
author6,and randall is 4 or 6

author2,If @everyone is down we should probably do that today then. Cause we can’t do it tomorrow.
author7,i spose
author10,sure why not idc
author5,<@!151500793990742016> <@!146626274066956288> <@!151489352164311040> how about you guys
author2,I’d still say 2 or 3 is reasonable but it could vary
author4,"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Free%20Actions&Category=Action%20Types
Core rule book description"
author4,But I think this description is from Unchained
author4,This forum just seems to be debating how many is considered reasonable. Since the rules are vague about it
author4,Yeah sure
author5,btw the next session of Wotw is gonna be pretty much just planning and gathering info. So if @everyone is down we can do that before Wednesday or Thursday.
author4,Can you sent link to where you found that?
author5,2 or 3
author4,How many free actions do you get in a round?
author7,^ randalls 10
author7,^ my 10
author4,🇧 ingmaker or WotW?
author4,Yeah I'm down
author5,Alright TJ and Randall said yes
author7,i suppose
author5,@everyone you down to try for tomorrow? I've got the itch.
author5,not today
author6,fyi if theres pathfinder i cant do it today
author6,tristins not here so i became gm
author6,its alright me and law are exploring arounf the tuskwater rn
author10,This is gonna take at least another 30
author4,Whole world revolves around her
author7,you fine
author4,Gonna be late because my sister is a bitch
author10,maker of kings
author25,I vote kingmaker
author5,What would everyone want to do tomorrow? cause I'm down for Way of the Wicked or Kingmaker.
author10,that doesnt seem right
author12,"<@146626274066956288>  :game_die:

author4,Gorgar says he he he ha
author2,<@613394585330253844> avinash with the buffs got some crazy damage
author4,Makes more sense
author2,no thats magma
author4,Wait is that Empyreal?
author2,def LG
author4,I will :)
author2,keep this in mind
author4,Will get on that lmfao
author4,So the Eastern & Planar + New ones
author2,New ones + old paizo ones
author4,The new ones or the old ones
author2,We need a rating on a scale of 1-10 how Gorgar feels about each species of dragon
author4,Oh 100%
author2,I bet he’d have good opinions on politics
author4,I like this guy
author2,in the other westmarch rogue is by far the most played

author2,current makeup
author4,"Anyway
We still have another session until Libarby yeah?"
author2,outside of just making it'
author2,I still need to do a lot of the other stuff related to this map as well
author2,The map I'm talking about has had a whole day dedicated to it and is still not done
author2,nah. The map or maps for that session was/were easy(ish)
author6,It better be
author6,Is it the orphan's soon to be college?
author2,I have put too much time into a certain map
author2,hows it going
author2,uno mas
author2,Hmm. A message was deleted
author2,You've told me that but this is the first time I've seen it in an official capacity
author4,Also your spade as black
author4,Wym I described the door in the kobold mine as black?
author7,bro is a whole. ass. unit.
author2,shoulders alone are like a large creature
author2,man he is so squat
author2,I have been told it is but this is the first time actually seeing it
author2,also this may be the first evidence I have personally seen of adamantine being black
author2,Adamantine golem built different
author2,In the end awakened animals will end up just being a custom ancestry
author13,If we ever get that far
author13,Yea I need to learn type 1 and give it to awakened animals anyone plays lol
author13,Could be a solution but could be fucky with allowed starting gold amounts or whatever
author13,What does it cost to make a tiny bag of holding or equivalent tool that furic could give to awakened little animals to let em have normal inventories
author2,Sprites and Poppets can both get tiny
author14,Cause Pixies are a thing
author14,I think there are rules that reduce the bulk of tiny objects
author13,I would be down for an alchemist crow though. But i feel like he wouldn't be able to carry jackshit without being over carry weight.
author14,"Through the power of friendship, your familiar becomes a valid target for Awaken Animal"
author13,Bro you know what I mean
author14,Technically none of this is real
author13,Especially as a familiar with the familiar specific wizard subclass thing
author13,"Nah it's a familiar, not a real animal. Not sure how that'd work"
author2,cast it on the crow and make it alchemist lol
author4,This is enlightened
author13,lmfao or something similarily dumb
author13,"I have asked if once Furic can do level 7 rituals, and if Furic learns the Awaken Animal ritual, i am playing a character whos an awakened squirrel rogue"
author13,Just so everyone knows
author2,"btw cause it is relevant to multiple people
Oculan was changed from Gold and Silver dragons to Empyreal and Sky dragons"
author13,"Basically ima drop 3 sessions worth of summaries, get 60 exp, then use 4 days of downtime to get level up. Can the rest of my downtime be me spending 80gp to get lvl 5 house with a ritual room?"
author2,fair and valid
author13,My internet just went out and idk why
author1,added context:
author4,This ^
author2,Lots of NPCs
author28,Oh yeah I forgot to do that thanks
author4,We are fucked
author4,Oh no the Pharaoh is using sacred geometry
author4,Tristin doin the forbbiden metamagic
author2,Follow up on a scale of 1-4 how many?
author2,bringing down the average I see
author28,Oh well
author28,I assume you're asking the success of the last campaign
author29,what does this mean
author2,On a scale of 6-21 how many?
author2,"Rome, Furic, and Gorgar all one decent session from 5"
author2,surprisingly no level ups that session
author6,Rome roaming inspired me
author4,<@151489352164311040> the mission name is killing me
author29,*o h*
author2,<@613394585330253844> Avinash has been under leveled for a couple sessions
author2,Finished one story mission. Gained two more.
author2,If anyone requires me now would be a good time
author13,I apologize. Shit kinda hit the fan and I had to fix some shit
author13,Shit happened and I was driving around in a panic. Completely forgot a session was tonight somehow
author2,allows me to vet people outside of nepotism
author13,The new people thing
author13,Oh right
author2,look in the guild
author13,The what
author2,The test oneshot has been initiated
author2,imma say just old so we dont run into problems
author6,Is that a choice that can be made for new characters? Or just old ones?
author2,"I dont think there are any pre-remastered characters, but with the archives release I will restate that you can choose to stay legacy or switch to remaster"
author2,There is one character who is prob from there but I don't remember if they asked yet
author2,also no
author4,Funnier if its blackwater
author4,"Which one
(Is it Ironspire)"
author2,Paizo stole the name of one of my towns 😔
author2,Gonna wait till when archives updates to organize grimy gremlins so people don't get confused
author2,A lot of level 2s so I imagine more will come up soon
author2,3 have been given
author2,I think they are good
author2,anyone missing a story mission? If you are level 3 and I have your backstory you should have one.
author13,"You dont understand, I HAVE TO USE THEM ALL"
author13,I think autocorrect got me. But idk how it became hand
author2,Yeah. Hat though
author13,<@318536129727168512> should I just add a new Hand of the Magi item to furic then? For his Arcana +1?
author2,unsure exactly how it works but we have this now
author2,I have given them to most people who use unarmed attacks
author2,The summoner has been linked to the summon
author2,but it works off the base system and needs the handwraps to put the runes on
author2,No I added something that does runes automatically
author4,Wait did you disable it entirely?
author2,One note about this is that players who use unarmed will need to add handwraps to their inventory and invest them
author2,One benefit of this is I just gained the ability to make a summoner and eidolon share a health pool
author2,Its nothing crazy. Just level 3s were automatically getting a +1 to a skill and now they aren't so I'm giving an item to compensate.
author29,Good thing i'm not level 3 yet because I don't understand what these words mean
author14,Glad I got that tattoo on sale
author14,Ooh yay I get another skill item
author2,"<@&868889886839689217> I am going to be changing Automatic Bonus Progression slightly to Automatic Rune Progression 
- Now only fundamental weapon and armor runes will progress
- Special staves and kinet things will still be given from story missions (for casters)
- Anyone level 3+ will get a free +1 skill bonus item (run it by me so I know you aren't grabbing some weird op item)
- Skill bonus items will no longer be half priced"
author14,Finding my boat
author2,aka probably
author2,you have not found out
author13,Was there ever a reason to follow the shamblers path more?
author4,Gorgar in particular may start looking for the Oculan Knight at some point (and/or visit home)
author4,Maybe head out to meet some of the starting NPCs

author14,"I'm pretty sure I can throw this up to 60 feet with better accuracy than my crossbow, and deal more damage"
author14,Instead of a crossbow I'm frankly terrible at using
author14,I should get one of these as my backup ranged weapon https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=336
author2,<@589289513788899348> dont forget to level
author13,"I mean I only said that because he described yall as ""sick nasty"" lol"
author4,This is funny cause the campaign is about a werewolf plague
author13,You could run a dnd/pathfinder 1shot like a werewolf game now that I think of it
author2,nah we good
author13,Oh. Fun. Enjoy being cursed then
author2,werewolf hell
author13,"Jk jk, no clue what campaign yall playing, have fun. Just curious because I saw so many in there"
author13,I hope the dogs give you a disease lol
author2,nah we are sick nasty
author6,Just a lot of dogs
author2,lol lol

author6,Session for different campaign lol
author13,Damn why so many in voice chat lol

author14,Sir Jelly of Crabsford is ready for battle
author14,Token added
author14,I like it
author2,"It is a mix of scorpion, crocodile, and snake"
author14,Oh this support benefit actually works really well for my build
author2,folders act weird
author14,Okay cool now its working
author14,Am I supposed to be able to see its stats?
author2,I called it jelly
author2,It should be in the folder with your characters
author14,In which case I still do not have access but it is for a very different reason
author14,Unless I am being stupid
author14,I do not have access to its stats
author2,btw if anyone has something uncommon (or rare) in their gameplan let me know so I can set it up for you
author2,crab added
author14,"If I go for anything above a bachelor's, I defenitely won't be doing both"
author4,"Idk though I wouldnt know
I always struggled with Chem"
author14,"Damn, yeah that's harder stuff than I'm doing"
author4,He got special permission to sub a bunch of undergrad classes to double count credits toward a doctorate
author4,"Fair enough
Most of the stuff my friend does at this point is graduate level I suppose"
author14,Maybe it gets harder tho
author14,Beyond that only about 15% of each course is new information
author14,Biology is pretty trivial in terms of the classes I've taken so far... the biggest problem is remembering the names for everything
author4,"Damn
My buddy is a chem major
And the shit he does is above my head
Cant fathom doing both chem and bio"
author14,The most difficult classes I've taken are  math
author14,It is not as difficult as people say it is
author6,I call exploring danger
author14,Biology and Chemistry double major
author4,Chem E?
author4,Wait whats your major?
author4,Super bowl is boring af
author6,You should put the key either somewhere on the map or in the 7 kingdoms journal
author14,I'm doing organic chemistry homework right now... any means of procrastination is welcome
author2,2 people joined instantly
author2,damn that was quick
author2,"red: danger
blue: friendly
green: ally/safe (you can start a session from these)
grey: neutral"
author2,Color coded the map icons
author4,Found that feat that got brought up the other day
author2,I watched most on release day
author4,Rules Lawyer video
author2,I stopped Oliver from dropping a weapon
author2,Yeah I've known of it
author4,I found out last night
author4,Oh really
author2,Came up this session
author4,So no more dropping weapons as a free action lol
author4,"As a side note for everyone
The pf2e remaster apparently added this line to interact"
author28,Y'all imagined a goblin with a gun following you
author28,I guess I wasn't there today
author28,Oh yeah I forgot to register my character
author2,Love that I cant delete those rename messages in this sessions thread
author2,But this is a trial so it is repeatable
author2,If you guys get strong enough you could try to deal with the big thing
author13,"oh got it, not as exciting"
author2,it shuffles each time
author2,the other route would be basically the same except with different bombs
author13,"well now i wunna schedule another session where we go down the other route, i want to gamble on that d100 more"
author4,Train a bit late should be on time still
author13,my character is just gunna bonk everyone
author2,It makes a smaller point of impact on the shield
author2,Its like frying pan vs baseball bat
author13,"So my character has everything shield related, and the shield boss is a wierd addition, is it just a hunk of blunt metal to smack people with?"
author28,Once I get home
author28,Speed run time
author28,Oh dear
author13,My dude has way too many reactions currently lol
author28,When is campaign start?
author6,The caves require it so
author28,"I swear I'm almost done with my character, the past few days have been busy"
author13,So is this a all level 1 mission
author13,"also my ac gunna be shit until i get some gold lol, i skipped out to save a little gold ill admit"
author13,i dont know why lol
author13,every time i touch my character it puts a popup saying i already have glimpse of redemption
author2,Vorc the Dork Orc Sorc of York
author4,Vorc the Orc Sorc of York
author13,Vorc the Orc the Sorc
author4,Omw to make Vorc the Orc
author13,"i need to find a image, lets see if i can find a temp one"
author6,V is a strong orc letter
author13,lmfao did we both make orcs with names that start with v
author13,Thank ya
author2,it up
author13,"I dont have an image for him yet unfortunately, is that fine for one session?"
author2,Yeah I can
author13,<@318536129727168512> would you be able to turn on foundry so I can upload and make sure he is added correctly? Or is it open currently?
author6,Tattooed orcs are lit
author2,More holdscarred for that matter
author6,"Personally I would be fine with it, more orcs the merrier"
author2,If anyone wants me to put a character into foundry feel free to send me a copy
author2,<@589289513788899348> <@287398314796908545> don't forget to put your characters in <#868890602186608670>
author2,pathmuncher is now working and hybrid should be fine. The hybrid session for sunfire didn't have any issues related to it being hybrid.
author13,Maybe not
author13,Fuk I also need to upload him
author13,But that's only if all the members are fine with it because idk if it'll work well
author13,If we end up wanting to try hybrid I'd join with my new orc shield dude
author4,Yeah L you
author2,On my end
author2,No. Maybe a mobile issue
author4,"Weird
Fix it or no?"
author2,For me the what line is up with the names
author2,No but the what? is a bit off
author4,I miss anyone <@318536129727168512>
author2,"Ethical is kinda like laws (think code of ethics)
Moral is like learned from community 
Personal is an ideal that is different from your peers"
author2,"Ethical, Moral, Personal"
author2,Just listened to a very good way to construct edicts and anathema
author2,<@287398314796908545> welcome back
author7,based honestly
author2,he's just really passionate
author2,guys the slavery god isn't bad
author14,I may use that at some point
author14,Turns out if you go far enough North or South you just walk into the Plane of Metal
author14,"It would also be very hard to have a magnetic field (for both compasses and living purposes), but that isn't very relevant for a fantasy setting"
author6,You can thank the star god for that
author14,Stars all wonky
author14,"If it is, then the methods of navigation they used for earth wouldn't work here"
author6,Implying Agrios isn't flat smh
author14,It would be good to know for ocean navigation anyways
author14,Van will seek out this information next time he's in a large city
author14,Surely somebody has calculated the diameter of the planet by now
author2,me to know
author14,Unless there are other continents out there
author14,"This setting also seems to be physically smaller than Golarion, so this makes a lot of sense"
author2,Putting the mythos on paper and it's making a lot more sense than I first thought
author4,Yeah cause no character can match the swagger of Cayden
author2,fun fact. For reasons. All of the gods on Agrios (this setting) are weaker than most Golarion gods.
author2,Best party icon
author2,I win
author4,You da best chief
author4,Hold on it gets worse
author4,The panache effect is so overkill
author4,Let me grab Bon Mot
author2,ben shapiro lookin
author4,Reminder don't forget to swap you current character in foundry before buying items :(
author4,"Yeah it's getting stuck on my ultra rare ancestry
Halfling"
author4,I see :/
author2,I updated modules yesterday although pathmucher has had issues for a bit
author4,"Hey Tristin is Pathmuncher up to date?
My stuff is hanging
I can enter it manually if need be but"
author2,or Osirion
author4,"Tristin has also expressed a lack of desert giant art before
And that the ones that do exist are ugly as sin"
author2,or hero forge
author4,"If I had a nickel for every time I've heard this
I'd have two nickels"
author2,look up egyptian people
author14,I mean there's this guy but he'd probably work better for a fighter
author14,There isn't very much art for desert giants
author4,I'll show you spam
author2,1 down 2 to go
author4,Ie a new map would be downloaded
author4,I was making a joke that the world  would end when the orb hits 100%
author2,I think he was referring to the orb having a %
author2,I think he is buggin buggin fr as they say
author13,Didn't want to put questions and stuff in hall
author13,New map? What?
author4,"Yeah thats how I've always used ruler
Didn't know about the right click pop out"
author2,If you right click a tab it does the pop out tab
author2,If you just hold control and drag click it uses the ruler tool
author4,Fair (doesen't hurt to have it in more places)
author2,shops will be included
author2,Currently working on statting all the settlements you've been to
author4,Added tat shop as well
author2,"The slain founders were from Enidor, Oculan, and Thetis"
author4,"<@318536129727168512> Anything I should add to that summary?
Trying to make it descriptive for the people who missed it since it was plot heavy"
author2,bro up to something
author2,Sovi Datarus
author2,You could of. It is Sovi
author2,The queen?
author4,Did we get girls name?
author4,"Black night was Enidor
Girl was from Datarus?"
author2,and Brainy Bin
author4,Surefoot something
author4,What was kid named again?
author2,god I love making the stat block for the goblin settlement
author2,Ulmus Bovia and Vurgas
author4,And Thetis king was Ferguis?
author4,And how you spell Bovian Kings name?
author4,Cabby guy was named what again
author2,12 days
author2,longest in world mission so far
author6,Bovia Blast
author1,this sounds good.  thank you again
author4,I like King of Bovia btw ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGmXGkIr7w0||
author2,The Hall can be rp outside of the guild
author2,I will probably skip through travel a bit more in the future or at least make it brief and leave some of the other stuff for sessions focused on that or rp chat.
author2,standable. I did account for that part time wise a bit better but it still could have flowed better. Everything leading up to you arriving at the council was 3 hours and then everything after was 2.
author4,"Did have fun to be clear just time constraint pain got me jammed up
I was working on hw the last hour of the session or so"
author1,"it was good dw, not criticizing too hard. just felt like it would have worked better if it was more ""x, w, z happened, what do?"" instead of ""x happen, what do? y happened..."""
author4,"I think the travel should have been minorly railroaded
Like removed the option of ""anything you want to do"" at each checkpoint (Though I was glad to see Fennek on the up)"
author2,I didn’t want it to be too choreographed incase you guys wanted to step in
author2,Plot stuff
author4,I made a bunch of skeletons that the party couldn't damage really with a ass ton of hp
author1,bone shaped meat grinder
author1,skeleton grinder
author29,Can I have the skeletons
author4,Basically I made an oopsie when I was still a pretty fresh dm in 1e
author1,you dont want to know
author1,i will say after getting there the social stuff with the royalty did feel like it could have been condensed
author4,~~Or the skeletons~~
author4,~~Please do not invoke the Archon's name~~
author2,That part was good on time. Leading up to getting to Cliffhall was the issue
author4,"I consider 3hr the magic number
5hr for one shots and climatic sessions"
author1,imo running off to find shops and sketchy theives is fun but it takes a while to do every time
author2,At least in the case of pit stops
author2,Will do. Will probably try and leave looking around for their own sessions.
author1,agree :)
author29,3 is a good time
author4,But yeah I would prefer next session be closer to the 2.5-3 hour mark
author4,Gorgar on his way to Oculan
author29,That's what the next mission is
author29,Next session let's commit genocide
author6,"I vote we murder hobo, that would have been so much quicker if we just killed the king first thing"
author2,Today's was kinda long cause I didn't want to rush too hard through the travel
author2,Wednesday ended up not being too bad but yeah this one and the Gorgar one were
author4,But they have been plot focused ones so
author4,As a seperate note session have been kinda long recently
author2,arcane scroll shop at that
author4,Aight so <@244474569102983168> Scroll shop located
author1,delete this
author4,Look I wasn't seeing enough schmoovment
author4,All aboard the Gorgar express we can all go 7 hexes instead of 5 when I'm around
author4,"Tristin do you mind helping me with some stuff rq
I got stuck on the retraining"
author2,-Blink doggos
author4,+160 total I believe
author13,+20 +20 +20 +20...
author13,Gorgar be getting that exp
author2,ye you can
author14,I do not have a practical application for this but making an entire suit of armor from some stuff you have laying around is funny
author14,Could an alchemist make one of these with reagents?
author2,6 down
author14,Herbalist isn't such a bad idea
author13,Alchemist who just cooks up pastries
author2,Flavored herbalist or alchemist
author14,Or something along those lines
author14,Is there a chef or cook archetype?
author15,i can hear that lisp and jive talk plain as day
author15,words cannot describe the double take i did thinking you just said Dusty Rhodes in that sentence
author14,"The shield block increase won’t scale well, but having shield at will is still useful"
author14,The Dusty Rose Prism one is interesting
author4,It's not like she won't restock eventually
author13,"Being undead has me buying every possible healing source, in sorry lol"
author13,Those ones are the healing 1hp per minute
author13,So they should have 2 left if I am correct
author2,I saw that
author13,"For general knowledge, I bought a pearly white spindle aeon stone"
author2,and go through and put stat blocks for the cities and merchants you have been to
author2,Because I get the feeling it will be asked tomorrow I am actually going to prep merchants this time
author4,"A variety
I bought a Pearly White Spindle
I think she had 3 left of that one"
author14,What kind of aeon stones did they have?
author14,Oh I just saw this
author13,"Let me know how the escort mission goes, sad I'm missing a social quest"
author4,Numbing tonic goes crazy
author13,I never buy em.
author13,"I dislike temporary buffs, personally"
author14,I might just want to save up for a Crusher rune and a couple War Blood Mutagens
author14,"I'm still thinking about it, don't burn your downtime on it this time around"
author4,As a note to people who dont know we did find an aeon stone shop
author13,<@554770810556907540> do you actually want a elemental Sentinel though? It's kinda expensive so I gotta ask
author13,"I said my unavailability in general because I was gunna bring up getting a puppy that's gunna chew everything in sight, but it very quickly just became scheduling lol"
author2,To scheduling with you
author13,I'd be down for 6 imo
author4,I was thinking maybe the escort job Fri at 5 or 6
author29,Did one session and now I need *more*
author13,"But Saturday to Monday I'll be out of state, getting a puppy with my mom because she hates driving hours by herself lmfao"
author29,*I'm available most days*
author13,Friday I think I'm good. I think.
author4,Wb Friday?
author13,"Well I'll be unavailable this weekend, so if anyone schedules I won't be there"
author2,Yeah. Spell level dc + 5
author13,Its always a very hard level dc
author13,Rituals are hard
author14,For a level 1 ritual?
author2,Nah the dc is like 21
author14,It’s not even a crit fail cause you made the DC
author13,That thing actively trolls you lol
author13,Technically the 5% is worse than a failure
author14,"5% chance of failure, and 45% for normal success"
author14,So against level 1 DC that’s like 50% chance of crit success
author13,"Its +2, so I have a +14"
author13,Forget which it is
author13,Plus I got ritualist so that's like an additional +1 or +2 to it
author13,"Well, that and the DC for Rituals was something I was confused on"
author14,Oh yeah cause you're level 4 now
author13,Its actually higher for a good result
author13,My chances on bazaar are incorrect
author14,Seems potentially useful
author14,I might get an Elemental Sentinel from Furic
author4,But it seems kinda mid till 8th level
author4,They can get soul synchronization which seems pretty good
author4,"It looks like its built specifically for war of the immortals
Otherwise it seems to let you be a tad tankier
Definitely seems pidgeon holed though"
author4,As well as playtest if you ever need the playtest again
author14,I still don't know why Sage is a thing
author4,Tristin has a module for it in pathbuilder and foundry pinned in 2e resources
author13,Sage or channeller it seems
author13,"Which ones the better one, I'm only reading it for the first time now"
author14,"They've only got two ""subclasses"" and one of them is definitely better than the other, but overall they look pretty fun"
author14,They're pretty cool
author13,I kinda want my 2nd character to be an animist
author14,But it's on the list for party comp so I assume it is allowed
author14,idk if it's in foundry yet
author13,Like is that on archives at all yet
author14,I'll dig it up real quick
author13,Can I find the animist info anywhere?
author29,I saw it yesterday . Poor jellyfish
author14,"No, it is evolving"
author13,"He had a jellyfish pet before, and now it's being thrown away like trash"
author14,And I can knock people over if I want
author29,Crab is good
author14,tldr; I have a giant crab and I hit slightly harder than I did before
author14,It'll still be named Jelly
author14,I'm upgrading Jelly into a giant hermit crab
author13,Rip jellyfish
author13,Were you the one with the jellyfish
author14,"Okay, the plan:
Retrain Witch archetype to Cavalier
3rd Level - Expert in Athletics, Untrained Improvisation 
4th Level - Knockdown, Titan Wrestler, Impressive Mount (Free Archetype)"
author14,And Fleet's kinda useless to me too
author14,Especially because I don't really need any Inventor feats from 1st or 2nd level
author14,I suppse Knockdown would be a good investment so I have something else to do with my two actions other than Power Attack
author14,I don't even really need Furious Focus anymore because I'm gonna have a crab who can attack for me on that third action
author14,It's kind of funny how few of the actual fighter feats I need to make my build work
author14,Oh it only works for treat poison and treat disease
author14,So I can battle medicine using Occultism instead of Medicine
author14,I think I'm gonna pick up Crystal Healing instead of Fleet
author4,Normal Van Karthy things
author14,And I'll be retraining to get a giant crab mount soon
author14,Level 3!
author2,Vorche (Crab Master)
author14,Okay coming now
author14,May be 5-10 more minutes
author2,regional languages added to the slides. They are all derived from preexisting languages that are listed. Basically American English vs British English kinda thing. If you understand one you understand the other.
author13,"Finding better modules n shit, making maps, etc."
author13,"Can I just say I've been starting a foundry for a few friends to test dnd 5e and I vastly appreciate what you've done for us all the more, tristan."
author2,helping noob
author13,Damn who's having a party in voice channel
author14,Probably true strike just because I can't both Power Attack and Spellstrike at the same time
author14,Do I want True Strike or Spellstrike more
author14,Considering retraining my Witch archetype into Magus
author6,I am going to assume prop not until full release?
author6,Did they ever make archetypes for exemplar and animist?
author2,May have to risk adding some weirdos. We'll see.
author2,I especially like fated shot and noble branch (prob cause they aren't basically copies of fighter feats)
author2,All the weapon ikons are fire
author2,Looking at exemplar again and man is it cooler than I remember

author4,No in 2e :(
author1,yes him

author2,not as good looking as great jagras
author16,top 5 best looking monsters
author2,big boy
author16,time to main glaive
author2,I cant sell it
author16,i spot a lonely kinsect
author16,thats a lot of bows
author2,I got all pre-elder bows
author16,which is reasonable considering what they are
author16,the highest level monsters would be level 26
author16,"well technically
going by its first appearance, it would be level 23"
author2,there will be some exceptions
author16,Instant death
author16,Lvl 101 ruiner nergigante
author2,here me out. Make all the monster hunter monsters in pf. And you can just make their level equal to the HR needed to fight them + 2
author2,I imagine that will (if scheduling allows) give everyone a solid chance to play each week
author2,I’m thinking for session restriction I do: if you have participated in a session that week (mon-sun) you must wait till day of to join.
author13,idk why
author13,"Actually i might not today, my games stuttering a lot"
author13,will soon
author13,shit weapon

author2,when you are free

author16,it could be worse
author13,So much drama
author13,These scenes are so tense
author2,wanna help me with legiana
author13,Great Jagras is dead. Which means the handler is the only fatass remaining who id like to remove from the local area
author16,would keep stuffing her face with food
author16,there could be a war starting and she
author2,Odd mine isn’t a cat
author16,and yes handler is obnoxious
author13,"When i rejoin MHW while the game has an in-game event and the Handler (whos so annoying, i forgot) is in a literal cat suit"
author13,Well okay then
author13,"If yall are serious about playing world together, should I just put my steam friend code in this chat for yall"
author2,"earth, water, electric, and fire beat"
author13,Oh God all my friends are messaging me about palworld or whatever the new slavery pokemon-esque game is called
author16,but without the benefits of being able to turn into a werewolf
author4,So lycanthropy
author16,and could only be cured through high level magic
author16,a magic prion disease would give stacking penalties to mental ability scores
author4,I feel loke ghoul fever is just a magic prion disease
author16,"thats how you get a prion, not ghoul fever"
author4,Okay but like what if you just do a lot of cannabilism and hope wedigos dont get you first
author2,You feel fine for 6 days after a ghoul bites you and then just perish
author2,Because it does negative damage it does nothing until stage 6 at which point you just die
author4,Vampire L
author4,Damn no protective penumbra in 2e
author2,ghoul fever just kills them
author2,unfortunately skeletons can't become ghouls
author16,yes thats the problem
author2,that requires you to find a vampire
author16,and then just die in a method of your choosing
author16,or pay someone to mummify you
author16,you could also go around throwing yourself at vampires asking to be bitten
author13,thats funny af
author2,Just try a bunch over a week and eventually you will be ghoul
author16,does it prevent you from casting it on yourself
author2,cause there is a spell that lets you inflict it
author2,ghoul you don't even have to ask
author16,"cause that one is just ""have a pc die and ask your dm"""
author16,ghost is the easiest
author2,ghoul is pretty easy
author2,I'd allow you to have an umbrella or something and be fine
author16,like Striga's day armor in Castlevania s4
author16,ie does wearing full plate allow you to go out during the day as long as you're fully suited up and never remove it
author16,although that depends on what you consider exposed to direct sunlight
author16,also taking vampire archetype makes you entirely incapable of doing anything during the day
author2,I think that just depends on GM
author16,the prereqs on the undead archetypes are really restrictive tho
author2,it just had some oversight
author2,I think it was a good idea
author2,they all give basic undead benefits same as skele
author2,"vampire, zombie, ghoul, lich"
author16,idk anything about the dedications
author2,I think the ancestry isn't any different from the dedications
author16,"i mean personally if I want to play an undead-associated character I'll just play a dhampir
partly because i think vampires are cooler"
author16,i feel like adding a fully undead ancestry might have been a mistake with how much headache it can cause
author2,They have a lot of stuff pointing in opposite directions
author4,Correct lmfao
author2,The 2nd is the problem child
author4,"Cause rn from what Ive gathered they are
An undead creature, treated as living, and have selective undead benefits"
author2,I feel like someone has to have brought it up at a Q&A or something
author4,It just needs a forum post or something
author2,yeah but players don't typically heal npc undead. I guess it could be useful in the case of undead companions but outside of that idk.
author4,Look Furic just has some crazy phantom limb syndrome
author4,Technically stich flesh works on anyone with the Undead trait which the race has
author16,at best it would just collect in the pelvis
author16,i feel like thats physically impossible as well
author2,Which in most games doesn't have much effect
author13,got it
author13,but somehow we can drink
author2,I have generally ruled it as no
author16,"which now makes me wonder if skeletons need to breathe
they aren't called out as not needing to
but they entirely lack all organs aside from the skeletal system, and are thus physically incapable of doing so, without any kind of alternate like the automaton's venting"
author2,and it was introduced alongside the undead player stuff
author2,My computer would not work well in a void
author2,cause it doesn't really have much of a use case otherwise
author2,I was just saying it supports the idea undead pcs should be treated as non-living
author16,"automata have a really funny situation when it comes to respiration
they dont need to breathe, but can still suffocate"
author2,I mean the plants are still living and they are somewhat suffused with the plants
author16,it just feels like a conrasu should be a construct
author4,I thought you were saying stich flesh disproved the RAW issue lol
author2,They have plant bodies
author4,Ohhh yeah misunderstood that message the
author16,they have the trait
author16,conrasu are plants?
author16,wait wtf
author2,I was just meaning that I would be treating him as non-living
author4,It wasnt that he was actually living but that he was treated as being a living creature or something
author16,they lose their stuffing lmao
author2,poppets also heal from positive unlike constructs so I think it is fair they bleed
author4,"Technically it was just that he would be ""treated as living"""
author13,lmfao yea i changed it thanks
author2,woah woah woah
author13,nobody screenshot that comment
author13,i dont like that ancestry
author16,poppet definitely needs a once-over from paizo
author16,that mouth does not seem very articulate
author16,not sure how thats gonna work out lol
author16,"they do get a +1 to saves against the things constructs are immune to (except bleed, ironically)"
author2,They also have to eat normal food though
author16,"i think they shouldn't be able to
as they are constructs and aren't called out as losing construct immunities"
author2,I've been testing a bunch of stuff with bleed to see what does it
author2,foundry says poppets can bleed
author2,especially with stitch flesh existing
author2,yeh you are consider not living
author16,unlike automaton which says you don't get them
author16,it doesnt say you don't get the other benefits of being a construct
author16,but the other thing about poppets
author4,I think the reason is in society play being a nonliving creature can make you immune to plot relevant things
author16,poppets are also called out as being living creatures
author16,"i feel like being an undead skeleton man isn't exactly being a living creature
and unlike automata being called out as being living creatures despite being constructs, skeleton does no such thing"
author16,i concur
author4,Which frankly makes way more sense logically but that may be the 1e player in me
author4,Prob not
author13,am i considered a living creature for spells or nah then
author13,Wait there was a conclusion in all that
author4,Yeah I just went down the rabbit hole and thought it was weird af
author2,already came to a conclusion
author2,just pondering
author2,We aren't debating it
author13,"I dont really care either way guys, im fine with anything"
author4,But yeah is they weren't a living creature they technically couldn't even be targeted with it
author2,oh yeah
author16,"its to call out how skeletons are immune to the death part only, but can still take damage and be frightened"
author4,Well they are immune to the spell but they get partial
author2,Odd that it does that since they are immune to death effects
author4,Even thoiugh technically
author4,Which is why in the write up it cites phantasmal killer being cast on the skeleton
author4,And it's supposed to be covered by the undead benefits
author4,But basically apparently it + examples in the book imply you are supposed to treat undead players as living for effects
author2,I saw people mention it was so... idk
author16,but we'll have to wait for aon to get updated
author16,nothing popped up in the remaster faq
author2,I think the undead trait may have got redefined in the remaster and/or will in monster core
author4,Supposedly but I can't find a sorce
author16,does it define it differently from the crb?
author16,mmm i see
author4,Apparently Book of the Dead defines the Undead trait weird
author2,bleed or undead benefits?
author16,i cant even find a definition of bleed on aon
author4,"And archives has it slightly different from the actual book
(Hopefully from some sort of etera I couldn't find)"
author4,Unlike anything else immune to bleed (like constructs)
author4,Basically the weirdness is because Undead's bleed immunity is listed in the definition of bleed dmg
author2,archives working again
author4,But just thought I'd mention the weird shit
author4,This is how I'd do it as well cause it's clearly RAI
author16,given they can use it as a fucking *cannon*
author16,for both the automata and anyone nearby
author16,"and if that core starts leaking, its a much bigger problem"
author16,but afaik its contained in a core
author16,they do
author4,They have life essence or something I guess?
author16,they literally dont have blood
author16,bizarre that automata aren't immune to bleed
author4,"As another weird side note
Automata are explicitly not immune to bleed but poppets may be in the same skeleton void"
author16,since skeletons have a much larger list of things rather than just slapping void healing and the undead trait on and calling it a day
author2,raw the undead stuff isn't busted or anything so I'll just run it as is
author16,i dont think they did
author4,I think they based it off dhampir or something and had some weird oversights
author4,"It isn't that he's literally ""living"" he's just treated as one for effects cause he lacks immunities or something dumb like that"
author2,What I was pointing out
author16,"they don't get any of the undead benefits, just negative/void healing"
author2,But they aren’t undead
author16,"they are, because dhampirs aren't undead"
author2,I know dhampirs are like this
author16,i feel like being a living creature and having the undead trait are mutually exclusive
author4,Which is a really weird gap in the rules
author4,Yeah but from what I've gathered Furic would have been a valid target for the siphon but his bird wouldn't
author2,I will stick with the no bleed to simplify working with foundry
author16,so its hard to research
author16,"unfortunately
aon is shitting its pants for me atm"
author4,But from what I've gathered Book of the Dead needs a remaster
author16,i feel like its raw as well
author16,but you may have found a piece im missing
author4,Yeah thats the obvious RAI
author16,thats my reading
author16,and it doesn't call that out
author16,furic wouldn't be considered a living creature because skeletons are not living creatures
author16,in fact it particularly calls out stabilize as having no effect on skeletons
author16,"from what im reading
that isn't one of the things listed in basic undead benefits"
author4,Apparently Bood of the Dead has a different version of the trait
author4,"So when an effect would say ""a living creature"" he is treated as such"
author16,you just also get the laundry list of things that make playing an undead character functional
author16,skeletons literally have the undead trait
author16,"no, furic is undead"
author4,"Okay so after intensive reading, technically RAW
Furic isn't undead
Player undead are living creatures with negative healing"
author16,monsters just implode
author16,particularly spread
author16,heavy bowgun trivializes the game so much lmao
author16,speaking of which
author16,shotgun bow
author2,Close range coating
author16,"why though
you can't get the satisfaction of watching the light fade from the monster's eyes if you're 8 miles away"
author2,stopping right before wildspire
author13,what weapon did you end up picking
author2,Tongue bitch bouta die
author16,"just you wait
the thiccest lizard will come for revenge"
author2,bird killed + lizard again
author16,but i play fromsoft games on controller so its not like id be starting from scratch
author16,id have to relearn if i played on controller
author16,ive gotten good on kbm
author16,same reason lol
author13,too used to it
author13,ima be using a controller 100%
author13,yall play with a controller or on keyboard?
author13,yea that fight im pumped for
author16,armor is absolutely dripped tf out
author16,both in appearance and power
author16,the weapons are great too
author16,"big monster, aggro mechanics, awesome looking party wipe move"
author16,such a fun fight
author16,Safi is great
author13,ive just never touched the safi
author13,yea i know about alatreon too
author16,thats not a joke btw
author16,versus Alatreon requiring a specific elemental weapon set depending on the exact name of the quest
author13,"i never fought fatalis in world, but ive beaten his ass in many of the old games so thats a usual hunt"
author16,just gotta break nergi's spikes so he doesnt crush you and break fatalis's head so he doesnt immolate you
author13,yes i have the layered armor on xbone
author16,"Nergi and Fatalis are definitely the best monsters to cap off World and Iceborne with tho
no real gimmicks to them, you just have to be good"
author16,extremoth also had a dps check in phase 3
author16,did you get Drachen layered armor from it? cause thats extremoth
author16,"he also had a move when he basically jump up and dunked you like a basketball
except that one comes out *significantly* quicker and can also oneshot you"
author13,or at least i THINK it was the extreme one? all i remember was doing it. i think it was extreme
author13,never felt a high like that in a while
author16,half the screen becomes a 3 billion damage hitbox
author13,dude i actually hit the jump meteor dodge on the extreme one
author16,yeah lol
author16,"same
jump meteor dodge is always so satisfying to pull off"
author13,was it his divebomb
author16,AT Nergi would instakill you through the best possible gear lmao
author13,i need a squad of 4
author13,well thats why im pulling you fuckers back into it
author16,that fight was ***hard***
author16,AT Nergigante was honestly peak World
author13,Got the armor from it and all
author16,damn you missed so much
author13,"i beat that extreme bitch though, with randoms"
author13,"I stopped playing after this event, if that gives you context"
author16,"kinda Alatreon as well, but I've been ohko'd by Fatalis from 200 hp with >1100 defense and 30 fire resist"
author16,id say the only things that matched that difficulty spike were AT Nergigante at the end of World and Fatalis at the end of Iceborne
author16,behemoth/extreme behemoth back in the day was wild
author16,giga bird
author16,the ffxiv collab was funny
author2,rock bitch
author2,your next bird
author2,great jagras down
author16,such a shame that all the best monsters are so late in the game
author13,*cocks shotgun*
author13,Papa needs a new hat
author16,"anyways
time to singlehandedly reduce the odogaron population for a slightly better friendship bracelet"
author15,and the accounts are free
author15,they have accounts to guarantee no card information leaks
author15,they're legit
author13,But ima do it
author13,They don't sell my credit card info
author13,I truely hope
author15,i try
author13,<@557292945754030094> you are one awesome bastard
author15,i will spread the good word of cheap mhw
author13,That's a steal
author13,"I guess, well, in fuckin buying it"
author16,is how they get the keys to resell
author16,different reasonal pricing/sales usually afaik
author13,Which is why I'm confused at this site I've never seen before lol
author13,Yea but it's a steam key
author6,In general its just fanatical takes less of a cut then steam so devs charge less
author15,fanatical got the deals
author13,That's such a deal
author13,Oh. Damn. How?
author15,all legit
author15,that's how i got it
author15,16 bucks
author15,all dlc
author15,mhw iceborne master edition steam key
author13,What is it
author14,I'm down if there is still a spot
author13,I dont think I've ever played 4man Hunts without randoms
author15,boy do i have the link for you
author13,Nah if yall would actually be down to 4man this shit I'd buy it
author2,I enjoy it but I can understand not
author2,I always restart
author13,But I'd have to restart.... hmmmm
author13,"I am fully ready to buy it on steam tho, I'll always support mh sales numbers."
author2,I originally played ps4
author14,I am
author13,Damn it man
author16,i am
author2,I am
author13,Yall on pc or what
author13,Damn it
author16,"it is not, unfortunately"
author13,Cuz I played it on xbone
author16,also lance charge
author2,Imma rep bow
author13,Is mhw cross platform
author16,constantly counter chaining > anything gunlance has
author14,Respectfully disagree
author13,"I like Lance, I have a full guard build and everything. Which I made to hold enmity while fighting the ultra behemoth back in the day"
author16,gun lance feels like shit to play
author16,"i run insect glaive, charge blade, and lance as my mains"
author2,gun lance gang
author13,But I'm not good at it
author16,lance gang
author13,Sometimes a little insect glaive for memes
author13,"In all honesty I play sns, gs, Lance, and dual blades"
author2,maybe not then
author14,Gunlance my beloved
author15,sword and shield is best
author2,I think I'll do sword board
author13,The only weapon is greatsword
author2,I've done all weapons
author2,I think I wanna go simple this time around
author13,What choice? All I see is a greatsword
author16,insect glaive >>>>
author2,the choice
author2,mhw and fo4 are 2 games I wish you could skip the damn start on
author2,and have done like 30 in fo4
author2,I've prob play through the main part of MHW on 5 dif characters
author16,i just get attached lol
author2,Gotcha. I almost always do if I've stepped away from a game.
author16,i 100%'d Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3 all on 1 character
author16,i just tend to never make second characters
author2,Ye. I usually restart when out of practice just cause it feels more natural. Don't touch my og though
author16,"When playing with newer friends in the past I'd still massively outperform them even with on-level gear
Just because I have 900 hours in the game and have gotten good at it"
author16,"I have 900 hours in one character, not way am I restarting
Plus I can always downgrade my gear"
author2,Is the game plan to restart if we play?
author16,Gotta unbalance the ecosystem
author13,I'm finishing eating lol
author13,one moment
author13,Alright. Apologies. I got a call back on something and wasn't expecting it
author13,Would it be fine if we move back the session to 5? I've had something come up.
author15,Yeah let's not have cars on fire
author2,car was not fixed but did not catch on fire so we are good
author2,If you want. I left the foundry up before getting in bed.
author2,In short you are free to level up
author2,Some special stuff is gained via that mission
author2,That is the reason I ask people to try and have it by then
author2,Each character gets a mission related to their back story at level 3
author1,"im confused, wym?"
author2,In your mission
author2,You don’t have to have it before level 3 btw. It just means there may be more of a delay.
author1,sorry my bad. i was hoping to finish figuring out a backstory tonight but since i can't ill do it tomorrow morning and just play one more session as level 2
author2,If I catch the car on fire we can push it back by 15
author13,Is 4 still alright then?
author2,gotta work on car before session tomorrow
author2,will leave foundry up
author2,sleep time
author2,I am just unsure of if they are or not. I prepped assuming they are.
author13,Are they the one at 980
author13,Are you wanting them to reply and join mission or for them to just level up
author2,<@589289513788899348> you're killin me
author13,Gunna be able to spam more spells yeaaaaaaaa
author13,Yea personal staves shall appease my spell addiction for a time
author13,"Every time I look at my character sheet I'm just like ""I need more spell slots, I want more spells"""
author2,I got bored
author2,level 9 feats added to foundry
author14,That's fair
author2,It basically would only happen at the start of combat though
author14,I think this should have a once per 10 minute tag or something on it
author14,I like this
author14,I have decided I will use this giant-kin ancestry
author14,They're considered slings unfortunately
author16,giantkin gunslinger with a literal hand cannon time
author14,"""You are trained in rocks."""
author2,There is no specifically desert giant heritage but goliath and maybe fire fit the bill
author2,I will add the rest when it becomes necessary
author2,ancestry feats up to 5th are in foundry
author2,"<@&868889886839689217> new ancestry dropped
https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/6qW1QBSb-giant-kin"
author16,what chicanery are you up to
author2,found something
author16,not sure if wrestler only gives expert and requires trained or if it also gives trained if you dont have it
author2,any heritages or feats that give athletics training
author14,Oh I see
author2,Was just hoping to get it like marshal where a thing pops up asking you which you want
author2,I can do it simpler than that
author14,idk how much of a pain that is though
author14,"And then for feats based off of that heritage, just make it have two potential prerequisites (like Genie Weapon Flourish)"
author14,"If you can't find anything, you could code it as two seperate options"
author2,but no skill feat attached
author16,since with that you pick between Intimidation or Diplomacy
author2,^my first thought
author16,most similar thing i can think of is the Marshal archetype dedication
author14,I'll take a look
author2,I wanted to find a similar thing in foundry to yoink code from
author2,Was asking for code reasons
author14,You could either split into two separate heritages or just leave it as is... I don't think there are any balance problems with having it as it is
author16,thats a heritage?
author16,"its that or an archetype dedication feat, but those usually given expert profiency"
author16,that seems like a background
author14,Assuming it's a permenant option
author14,"Usually that would be split into two different abilities and you just pick one of them, I think"
author14,Not that I can recall off the top of my head
author16,Rizzler background
author2,anyone know of an ability that works like this
author16,"admin giveth
admin taketh away"
author2,I can take it away
author14,mwahaha my name is slightly darker green
author14,That's cool
author14,Oh I am a Maker of Paths
author14,It gets significantly better at level 2
author14,This is a very tempting option for me
author16,i will never play that because i know id get the 25% 100% of the time
author14,Which could be funny
author14,"A level 1 Magus or Summoner with Wellspring Mage gets 0 spell slots per day, but a 75% chance of getting one each encounter"
author14,"Wellspring Mage is wacky, too"
author16,bloodrager was one of my favorite classes in 1e
author16,i really hope they add the bloodrager (or something similar to it) to pf2e
author14,A fucked up melee draconic sorcerer could also be cool
author2,Hold that thought cause I'm about to do something I may regert
author14,"If not, I play an Orc Oread anyways and it's sort of the same vibe anyways"
author14,"if I do that, would it be possible to be a desert giant in flavor? I don't know how extensive your lore about them is"
author2,or heritages rather
author14,Oh okay cool
author2,all the elemental ancestries are still a thing
author14,Actually Oreads might not be a thing anymore
author14,I was thinking an Orc Oread or something like that
author2,play a sturdy skeleton
author16,yeah they small
author14,Oh they're halfling-sized
author14,"If not, I play a Kashrishi and that's still cool as all heck"
author14,"Is there a giantkin versatile ancestry or anything like that, maybe?"
author2,And he is a desert giant
author2,Jabari is the branch manager for your branch of the guild
author14,ye have not seen Jabari then
author16,i know not what you refer to
author14,Like Jabari
author14,That could make a cool earth-air kineticist
author14,But like a small one
author14,I wonder if I could get away with playing one of those desert giants
author16,reminds me of genos lol
author16,steam knight seems fun to use
author16,a fire-water kineticist would be neat
author16,otherwise everyone is gonna start slipping and sliding everywhere
author16,Winter Sleet you definitely need safe elements though
author14,"And if it is, switch to cold. It'll be better against them anyways"
author14,"Unless enemies have a way of giving fire weakness, that's not really an issue"
author16,hopefully they dont have fire weakness lol
author14,"Gives them resistance equal to level, deals damage equal to half your level"
author14,Because it gives them resistance greater than the damage you're dealing
author16,yes it does
author14,Thirmal Nimbus also doesn't hurt allies
author16,still causes issues with concealment
author14,Desert wind doesn't hurt allies
author2,right now we have straight fire and straight metal
author16,"but who cares, fire aura junction + thermal nimbus is very funny"
author16,the only problems with desert wind and the microwave is the feat tax to avoid cooking your allies 😔
author16,getting to turn on the microwave is always fun too
author14,"Desert Wind is so good, but I also want to play another nautical themed character"
author16,"i really like fire-earth
lava leap is cool"
author14,I might play an air-earth air-water kineticist as my next character
author16,or ignite the sun and chase people with a giant ball of nuclear fire
author16,dazzle everyone in the backline lol
author14,Solar Detonation is great for bullying casters
author16,or when some kineticist summons a star to the battlefield lol
author16,I'd imagine any nature god who happens to be spectating probably shits themselves when that patch of land starts speedrunning the seasons
author14,Turn the Wheel of Seasons is a pretty wonderful feat
author16,and also really funny in how ludicrous they are
author16,all the level 18 kineticist feat names are absolute bangers
author16,"normal and lame ability name that concisely describes the feat?
fuck that, give me Infinite Expanse of Bluest Heaven or Usurp the Lunar Reins"
author16,come on
author16,and i love it
author4,So does some of the kineticist stuff to be fair
author16,and im all for it
author16,exemplar feats have some true anime bullshit names
author2,My exemplar has it
author16,oooh thats a nice feat
author16,it certainly should
author4,Theyve stated unarmed strike is at least getting one
author16,and yeah unarmed strikes not being covered would be really strange
author16,thats good
author16,didnt know that
author4,They have already said that isnt all ikons especially since unarmed strike isnt covered
author16,"one in particular being the meteor hammer, which would be awesome as a Titan's Breaker
but its a flail, so you can't use it as one"
author16,another thing ive noticed is that the weapon ikons dont cover all the weapons
author4,Also they are prob gonna get tweaked since it was the playtest
author14,What is even the point of the Sage Animist?
author16,yeah i know that
author16,namely Skin Hard As Horn just seems by far the worst of the body ikons
author4,You cant use more then 1 trancendence per round as a note
author16,"but from my first look at the ikons
i would not call them internally balanced"
author16,exemplar looks cool
author2,I actually have those both fully in foundry so they are playable
author2,yes kinda
author15,Ain't that the god fragment one?
author2,other is animist
author2,coming in war of the immortals
author2,It is one of the 2 new classes
author13,"saw that in scheduling, is that pathfinder or something else"
author13,what is exemplar
author2,want to avoid burying the stuff about fridays session if a discussion is started
author2,or <#828644638889476116>
author2,30 abilities added to foundry 😔
author2,and/or others are in town
author2,forget if I said it but now that we back from break we can do stuff in person if we have an all UNCC person session
author13,"i usually go 1 action to direct bird, 2 actions myself, but with mature beast i can just like.. let it do its own thing"
author13,my bird at level 4 gets its own actions so later on thatll be fine
author13,"yea ikr? i spotted it and was like ""damn thats just 1 more attack for so many people"""
author4,But sustained makes it a tad worse
author4,That kinda goes hard
author13,"with so many people using shields, i might have to grab this"
author2,3rd but they are something you find
author13,When do custom staves happen? Level 5?
author4,I did lmao
author13,OHHHHH that's so dumb. I may have missed him saying that earlier
author2,aura of dis pear
author2,aura of despair
author4,His Aura
author13,I still don't get why you posted this
author13,Pc just turned off on accident. BRB soon
author4,If I had a nickel for every grippli alchemist named Rana
author2,The other one was also a frog
author17,I chose the name because Rana is frog in latin
author16,how many nickels would you have
author4,If I had a nickel for every alchemist I've know named Rana
author2,If they wish 😔
author4,donjon 😈
author2,I’m good with whatever anyone wants to use
author4,ddraft or alchemist
author2,I forget if I said this but for those who purchase property if you want you can make a map and send it to me and I’ll put it in foundry
author2,which class
author2,*adopted ancestry
author16,and get pretty much anything to 4 ancestries
author16,yeah you can always take adopted ancestry as a general feat
author2,for 4
author2,You could do half-elf + adopted ancestry halfling + cultural adaptability gnome
author16,whatever you still get 3 ancestries
author2,adopted ancestry also specifies common
author16,halfing into cultural adaptability into skeleton into as in life so in death into gnome
author2,Adaptive Anadi does specify common ancestry
author16,*the quad ancestry anadi build takes no pre-approval*
author2,"Human + Beastkin 👍 
Hobgoblin + Beastkin 👍 
Anadi + Beastkin 🧐"
author2,"No restrictions on rare ancestries
Uncommon ancestry + versatile heritage is fine
Run rare ancestry + versatile heritage by me"
author16,"plus rare things generally coming from one place, so I just checked where the most logical place for a Goloma would be"
author16,you just can't use an uncommon heritage with a rare ancestry
author16,there's no restriction i can see against rare ancestries
author16,strix should be fine
author13,"U right, I looked past it. Yea strix  would require his permission so ill look elsewhere. I just don't wunna play a plain human and it still looks like the best option"
author17,I think it was posted in the questions chat
author13,"Yea I was just looking at the songbird heritage of it, thought that'd be a funny bard. I can't seem to find the character rules on Ancestry and stuff so idk"
author17,I don’t think so since it’s a rare heritage. Though it sounds like if you talk to Tristan you can work something out with it
author13,Is the strix race allowed?
author17,"got it, trying to figure out how out of place my frog alchemist is"
author13,Mostly exploring so far
author13,I'm sure in-city stuff is somewhat planned and Tristan is simply going along with what people ask for. Which so far isn't in the cities
author13,"Wilderness so far, but nobody has really looked into stuff happening in the town very much."
author17,Is most of the games in the city or wilderness?
author13,"Fantasy continent that tristan made. Sorta generic fantasy, towns and counties that specialize in certain themes."
author17,What is the setting of this westmarch generally?
author13,Also my phone keeps trying to autocorrect anadi to Canadian
author13,Im tempted to play an anadi but it'd be wierd af
author4,Maybe? I dont recall playing with him after the intro
author4,Is that the inventor
author13,Neons character? Aren't they a dwarf
author4,"Based
We have any dwarves yet?"
author13,I like the lingering composition feat
author13,I believe maestro so far. Typical bard.
author4,What flavor bard are they
author13,What race should I make my bard
author13,Oh. It's at the top. Oops
author2,rules 11 and 12 added
author13,brb need to let dog out
author14,Okay well I am definitely getting this https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2221
author14,Level 3 presumably
author4,Van Karthy aquatic adventure when
author14,You guessed the name
author14,May I have a token for my jellyfish?
author14,I don't think I should have that
author14,Where did I get Assurance from?
author14,Trust me it'll be funny
author14,I now have a little Jellyfish
author2,rule is you can ignore the 2 feat restriction on one archetype at a time
author14,Cool beans
author14,"We're allowed to take two archetypes at level 2, right?"
author2,putting xp amounts on all the sessions ftw
author2,so you are at lvl 2 130xp
author14,Oh I did? Nice
author2,looks like you did all 4
author14,I'm currently at 80 xp
author14,I definitely did not do all four
author2,(that assumes 4 reports)
author2,"so something like
210+280+220+260 sessions
20*4 reports
80 extra"
author2,3 reports + 80 from background and form wouldn't be enough to get you to 2
author2,710 from sessions alone before that
author2,I don't think so
author14,Oh shit I have Alchemical Crafting apparently
author14,I think I was
author2,I forget if you were 2 for the shrine delivery
author14,"Yes, I have"
author14,Have I played a game at level 2 on this character?
author14,"Sweet, thank you"
author16,Oh shit yeah I gotta do all that foundry stuff
author2,<@201805480694251520> dont forgor to do that
author14,<@318536129727168512> Are you able to open up the Foundry for a minute?
author4,Can Gorgar attempt a check based on 2nd hand descriptions he wasnt at that session
author16,Don't worry I know nature
author2,Furic got wrong info and Damian just confirmed it was wrong
author14,"We didn't, but I thought we at the very least got a type on it"
author2,I don't think you guys got any good info on it
author14,Which is mildly problematic when it comes to being clever
author14,"Okay, I don't remember what the Shambler *was*"
author2,you can do that anytime before first session as level 2
author6,I support the idea
author16,"Alternatively, find a bastion archon ans get them to fight"
author14,"My normal plan is to walk up and Power Attack it to death, but I have a suspicion that it won't work here"
author16,But also that's lame and we ball
author6,"Uh, trick it to fall into a hole"
author16,I mean I've yet to play a session so I believe I could entirely retool my character
author14,Sooo clever plan time
author14,"Aight, we'll either need more people or a really clever plan to make this happen"
author4,Trying to make that damn cellphone
author4,I got it on accident
author2,I like fishing
author2,I did that without trying lol
author14,Apparently I am not enough of a gamer™️
author14,I thought that was a lot
author14,I have about 375 hours
author13,Fuck the fisherman quest
author17,"I get that, I'm honestly treating it more akin to a rouge like"
author13,Plus like... I enjoy summoner and I always challenge daytime empress for her terraprisma and no way in hell am I doing that in one try.
author13,"I dont like hard-core in any game. Not even minecraft. Penalties to dying are fine, I just hate losing things permanently"
author17,"Over the past few months I've been trying to do a hardcore run, not getting very far cause I'm playing much to risky"
author17,Have you experimented with paints? Those are pretty fun
author13,I just like building in it from time to time
author13,"I have 492hrs. Not as many as yall for sure. I've got 100% achievement on steam though, and have done multiple master mode runs. But yea yall are much further in hours."
author17,I’m approaching 2k but it’s split over multiple accounts so I have no clue how many I actually have
author17,Hell yeah
author13,Summoner main represent
author13,I would be down
author2,Westmarch terraria server
author13,Yall ever play calamity mod? Shits wild
author2,Over 1.5k hours
author17,"Oh that’s very dangerous, I’ve have definitely fallen into Terraria’s grasp many times before"
author13,After hearing the terraria music last night now I kinda want to play and that's dangerous as I might have time start organizing a mod list again
author13,Oh. Yea I'd have to make a new dude
author2,You have to be weak to enter (level 1)
author2,The shuffled caverns
author13,Or am I having a small moment of being stupid
author13,Idk what caverns you talking bout
author2,(Next session he is in at least)
author2,After next session Justin can go to the caverns
author14,I guess I can't really argue because I actually have Inventor Dedication
author13,And then one character with a mismatch of dedications with the sole purpose to oneshot God
author13,Okay so for Tristan westmarch I will have bone wizard the utility dude
author2,also mauler dedication
author13,Sneak attack power attack
author14,"Powerfully, even"
author13,Might have to attempt a build on that sometime
author14,Simply attack harder
author2,fighter dedication
author13,How does one get power attack onto a rogue
author14,Bold words for someone in Power Attack range
author15,inventor best class
author15,overload best ability
author14,Power Attack-finder
author14,Power Attack is the only thing
author13,Nah I'm a martial class fuck that
author4,We lova casting spells
author7,shadow wizard money gang 🤙

author2,so I need a backstory by then
author2,It means I start doing backstory based missions at level 3
author6,I think it is a threat
author1,i do not understand what this means but i will do something
author4,"Thats my characters immediate family
Rip Gorgar the 1st though"
author16,"Eventually I will create a character where their entire family died peacefully of natural causes
No family drama or person who murdered a relative for them"
author2,"if not remedied you will be defaulted to our economy plan: ""Someone really strong wants you dead and may or may not take action the moment you hit level 3"""
author16,I use paid on mobile because the giftcard meant I didn't have to pay for it lol
author4,I use the free pathbuilder on mobile and the paid one on browser
author16,But then I found a random google play giftcard lying around and got pathbuilder2e
author16,I actually used Google sheets for pathfinder 1e and my first games in 2e
author4,"Based
I glanced at dndbeyond when I was initially looking at 5e and decided it wasbt worth bothering with it"
author16,I just have google sheets and 5e.tools and do it myself
author16,And I never will
author16,I have never used dndbeyond
author4,"Fair, its anoying that dndbeyond is the way it is"
author16,And is also impressive that it hasn't been nuked by wotc yet
author4,My longest has been a slayer in the aformention 1e campaign (Kingmaker)
author16,I will say that 5e.tools has some great ui
author4,Also Archives and d20 are cool
author16,Also yeah wotc sucks
author16,Then I played BG3 and realized how much it was being held back simply by being 5e
author16,And clerics can actually be fun to play
author16,"I enjoyed playing 5e for a while
Mainly because I played a cleric in the longest campaign I was in"
author4,I've never bothered with 5e cause I dislike WotC
author16,"2e is also so much better than martials in 5e
Where every turn is basically the same thing"
author16,What happened to armag
author7,💀 what an amazing image
author4,1 hit
author4,I still weep about Armag in Kingmaker
author4,Rare Law interaction
author16,"Yeah rocket tag gets a bit old
But it can be very funny sometimes
I have fond memories of playing the WotR crpg and doing 13+ attacks in one turn"
author2,resident floater
author7,"sorry for the intrusion, I've just come to say that I like your pfp <@201805480694251520>"
author4,2e made me enjoy martials again 1e rocket tag is rough
author16,And keep tossing someone around
author16,Gotta set up the whirlwind throw loop
author16,Wrestler archetype?
author4,I mainly tank and use athletics manuvers
author16,"I was tempted to pick barbarian 
But going ranger lets me attack a bunch with effectively no penalty"
author4,Animal Instinct Barb
author16,Got that ranger that doesn't interact with focus spells or an animal companion in the slightest

That rough buddy"
author2,You know who we're talking about? stereotyping only makes sense
author6,Literal stereotyping moment smh my head

author1,wait what
author2,<@589289513788899348> personal backstory missions start at level 3. You have been warned.
author2,too much significant shit happened last session
author2,I tried to keep it to 3 sentences per session (the last session was 4 though)
author2,I posted a summary of the overall story up to this point
author2,Enough brain cells have been used for one day
author2,I may need to go through and just universally increase numbers
author2,was guessing it was you

author2,Vurgas and Sarah
author13,"My shitty laptop just ran out battery, be on in a sec to hear anything final"
author2,let me know if anyone wants to add any
author2,items added
author13,Yea they're stored there so it'd make sense
author4,The hall maybe?
author2,any preference for what channel I make the item thread off of?
author30,At the end people list what their favorite and least favorite are so that's kinda neat
author13,"i want to reset it for the new stuff, so i know its set up right"

author2,You can find information on rules and the setting in <#868890485899526185>
author2,You can find information on setting up foundry pinned in here and in <#1154848615773253682>
author27,Got it
author2,Welcome <@456226577798135808>. Everything you'll probably care about is in this category
author2,Fixed a typo with the personal staves
author2,first level 2 btw
author4,Feyhunter seems to be vibing
author13,I'll be on in a sec
author2,we're waiting on someone else so you are good
author13,"My computer wouldn't recognise a mic headset I plugged in, so I had to do a windows update :("
author13,mic problems
author13,"Cleaning up from dinner, then I'm on"
author13,Tbh the focus spell from boundary is much better than call of the grave I have r n
author13,"I will be changing to new system, but I'll have to rework my spellbook"
author2,I was guessing that one
author13,"Big changes with Wizards (for me at least).
I get simple weapon proficiency.
Apparently I can cast with both hands full now.
School gives me 2 spells and a cantrip (cantrip is weirdly worded, dm may choose if I get it.) (At level 1, this is opposed to normal +1 cantrip I think? And one spell per spell level for the school.)
Each level up gives you one spell from your college, along with the normal +2 spells.
I believe I would use the School of the Boundary."
author13,Free magic items sign me the fuck up
author2,Just found out you can mask links so the rules are a bit nicer
author4,You see that is funny because Gorge
author2,I enjoyed when Gorgar Gorged all over them.
author2,let me know if anyone else wants a foundry journal
author14,I really liked figuring out where the traps were and using it to our advantage
author14,That was a cool encounter
author2,"""Once your done with those adventerous types meet us at the cave north of you. If the treasure map we found on that dead guy is real we won't have to serve under Dante for much longer."""
author14,I will be home in about 10 minutes
author14,If we end up having to stop that would be bad
author14,"Alright, Ill keep you posted on ETA"
author2,We could move it up by 15 minutes and then by the time people have got downtime and such done it'd be about 30
author14,I’m gonna be 30 minutes late… I’m deciding whether or not I should still go
author4,Yeah I got it the first time
author2,+3 at level 1 cause level + 2
author14,Always add level
author2,2 4 6 8
author2,also flex feats at late levels
author4,Isn't each prof lvl a +3
author14,My class’s biggest gimmicks are a +2 to hit and attack of opportunity
author2,fighters get expert prof so they always have higher attack bonus
author4,Yeah I was wondering what class got expert on a weapon that early
author2,"+4 strength
+6 prof
+1 potency"
author14,And automatic bonus progression
author14,That’s pretty cool
author14,Oh I’m going to be hitting at +11 at level 2
author4,At least not currently lmao
author4,Gorgar does not lol
author14,Cause I’m not gonna have to buy magic items later
author14,We also have the money for it
author4,"I believe they mentioned picking some up
But to be fair potions are actually useful in 2e so"
author14,"Oh okay sweet, might have healing then"
author4,Ollie is playing a druid
author14,We’ll be alright… I have a healer’s kit and I can buy more potions
author30,Yeah... hopefully the best status effect is dead holds true
author13,I'm gunna prepare 2 summon undead because I'm willing to bet this'll be hard since it's a party of 6
author4,Gorgar asserts that they deserve it
author14,And then Wizard and somebody else
author14,"Fighter, Thaumaturge, Keneticist, Barbarian"
author13,I mean its a mission legit to kill people so I'd hope
author14,Man we are loaded on damage
author14,The group I’m camping with reaaaaly dragged things out
author14,I might be a bit late
author2,put all the kingdom info in the foundry so that if you double click on the kingdom it pulls up its info
author2,foundry will be up overnight
author15,that seems more anti-hero than anithero
author2,"Looking for synonyms of antihero and one website had ""nazi"""
author13,Yea thats what I was thinkin
author2,That works in 2e. If he has prof in only craft and water lore stuff then he'd still be ignorant of other book smarts subjects. At least compared to people with those profs.
author4,"I mean int is book smarts
Doesn't necessarily mean they can apply it socially (Cha)
Or know when to actually apply it (Wis)"
author13,Like he knows his suit and ocean shit... and that's it?
author13,"You can roleplay it as a sort of ""very specific intelligence"" kinda thing"
author14,"Unfortunately, Van is smart now."
author14,"I’m gonna take the Inventor archetype and the armor innovation, to be my diving suit"
author14,Okay I’ve finally decided on my build
author7,even <a:wahdontfeelsogood:817837979631616051>
author2,I give people +1 privileges (as long as they are cool [and maybe epic])
author15,never lose joepe
author4,Joe mama
author2,Hows it Joeing
author2,btw if anyone wants foundry has a built in journal and I can give you one
author15,mark it in the history books
author30,first damage of the campaign?
author15,good lord
author30,the party destined to become a polycule /j
author15,the vibes are not giving
author13,"i dont really think so, shes the boss here it seems"
author15,sheeeee is SKETCHY
author14,Somebody new just walked in the door
author13,Brb lol
author13,Just accidentally turned my computer off
author13,A group of roughly 5-7 random wierdos.
author15,absolutely nothing
author30,What is more powerful than a group of roughly 4-6 random weirdos
author13,Just casually joining a guild after threatening a member
author4,Nothing more CG than threatening Paladins lmao
author13,"From that anime, goblin hunters long lost cousin, Faehunter"
author13,"Mages up top? Two. Looking over books.
Halfling woman below with unknown people.
At the bar, dwarven man. Pirate lookin man. Talking over drinks, mostly drinks.
Human in extravagent outfit below them. Even more drunk.
Pale short black hair, looking over dark spellbook.
White haired orc woman. Making food. Looks very strong. Star tattoos everywhere in patches."
author13,joining to set up final shit
author2,foundry up
author15,and massive weapons
author15,he has an appreciation for intricate armors
author15,i think Torbran will like your character just fine
author15,even better
author14,Diver suit with big anchor
author15,"zach, is your character little guy, beeg weapon too?"
author15,Just as Paizo intended
author15,Who up finding their path?
author2,I rest
author14,"Tomorrow is online, right?"
author14,Van Karthy is now a Fighter
author14,Okee dokee
author14,Is the foundary up right now?
author14,Okay done
author14,"I think it may just be the check penalty, but i wasn't 100% sure"
author13,I would imagine it's too heavy to swim in
author14,Oh I just realized Coral Armor is a thing
author14,Are there any penalties to swimming / being underwater for wearing heavier armor?
author2,good choice
author30,Looking at playing Thaumaturge
author2,Same rule. You can make whatever changes you want before the first session you play level 2
author14,"<@318536129727168512> Is it fine if I change to a Fighter, because I haven’t played yet?"
author14,Oh wait I should probably ask first
author14,I’m gonna make him a fighter
author14,I also might want to make this guy a fighter instead
author14,I might need a second token for the Eidolon
author2,thats in <#1154848615773253682>
author14,Now just to figure out how to export it
author14,Okay cool all done
author14,Okay this new build is a little weird but it could be fun
author14,Still a Summoner
author14,Yeah okay I'm gonna make a deep sea diver
author2,it'll prob be up for the rest of the day
author2,the foundry is up if anyone needs it
author14,I might need to re-make my character o.o
author14,DEEP SEA DIVER IS A BACKGROUND?
author2,There is a background google form and a campaign interest google form that you can do for bonus xp
author14,I'm re-making my character on pathbuilder so I can import it now
author2,You can find information on the setting in <#1093311801044770836>
author2,Welcome <@691389916172517386>. You can find information about foundry and setting it up pinned in <#1154848615773253682> and the planned first session is this Sunday.
author2,For people who aren't sure on edicts and anathema I suggest looking at this campaigns deities or the deities on archives
author13,"I'll make one tonight. I have yet to sit down and make my anathema and such yet, so it'll all work out and be done tonight. I'll dm a link to ya"
author2,Its a good structure to make one
author14,I have not done mine yet
author2,"instead of me having to keep up with DMs, head canons, and docs"
author2,It would be helpful if those who have done a background could do the google form so I have all the information in one place
author2,Looks like Sunday is the winner
author4,NCSU moment 😔
author7,I will be grinding from now until they are over 😔
author6,"Grind now, so you don't have to later"
author7,"theoretically I can make it any day after Wednesday.
but I also have all of my midterms coming up next week so I'm kinda in the grind"
author4,As a heads up <@&927426307514581042> I'll schedule my stuff dependent on the time Tristin finalizes stuff here (though I may have to cancel cause I'm busy as fuck we'll see)
author14,"Actually, statistically I will be... my 5e campaign that day is kinda dead"
author14,"I may be available on Monday, we'll see"
author2,<@&868889886839689217> react to this if you can’t make it any days
author2,"<@&868889886839689217> react to let me know which days would work best for you for the first session. After this session it will open up to player planned sessions.

author13,Oh. Wierd. I'll have to look because I have no idea this was even happening.
author2,"Heads up to people the following are getting changed with the remaster Nov 15

Classes: bard, cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, rogue, witch, and wizard

Ancestries: human, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, halfling, leshy, and orc

Heritages: changeling and nephilim

I will give you the option of updating your character or using the pre remastered version when these and future changes happen. For some of these I'm expecting minor changes but witch and wizard at least are somewhat substantial."
author2,<@298277388800753665> this category is where everything related to the campaign will be
author2,for all unfamiliar parties
author2,I will probably do a foundry intro session before the first session
author2,moved all the character creation stuff out of the google doc
author2,I just wouldn't go otherwise
author2,I've also been into the dorms to visit people
author7,I'll never tell
author2,and Im assuming was visiting someone
author2,You have lived in them
author7,I've done it 😔
author2,their bad
author6,Future pathfinder players might though
author2,I don't want to enter the dorms when I don't even live there
author14,Or from star quad… it echoes it real good around there
author14,Scream it from the roof of the library
author6,"Counterpoint, go door to door advertising to every dorm room"
author2,like 5 for now and then may open it later

author13,"Yea I figure, I'm just curious"
author2,still a little bit off
author13,When will session 1 of this be
author2,If anyone has suggestions let me know. This is subject to change
author2,yes unless it says something like increase
author6,So for the minor ... lesser ... moderate stuffs they are cumulative right?
author2,feel free to check that out if you want
author2,I also give you express permission to harass outsiders into joining
author2,but thats up to you
author2,Also if people want they can put a character in the <#868890602186608670> without specific info and add it later
author2,assuming you mean per one shot then yes
author4,Do we have 1 per
author2,its fine to do it now. You can just DM me the result and I'll tell you what you get
author13,Ah OK. Should I wait to get my character info into foundry first?
author2,I just need you to roll a 8 sided dice
author2,You can use one per character and yes it is a random item/items
author13,"Eh whatever I'll just test it. I'll use both mine, kobold and sunfire."
author13,What does it mean to use one?  Random item or something specific?
author2,"If you played in Struggle for the Sacred Tree, Trial of the Kobold King, Caravan's Gambit, or Sunfire Citadel you got a one shot box."
author2,Let me know if you want to use a one shot box
author2,(it will most likely not be everyone)
author2,"You can wait to register until after the first session cause that will be when you ""all"" arrive at the guild"
author16,your ancestry is a matryoshka doll
author4,Player ones at least
author16,"play an adaptive anadi with a skeleton form with As in Life, So in Death for Halflings, then take Cultural Adaptability for Dromaar
you are now a half-orc halfling skeleton spider"
author4,I was stating Echoes dieties like this for 1e
author16,20 dual class 10 mythic free archetype ancestral paragon
author2,I think this is how you make a deity
author2,When the 20 gestalt 10 mythic one shot dropping
author2,wait till I've prepped it to post anything though
author2,I got the idea for the one shot
author2,He will work
author2,Because of simplification in 2e the whip is more viable for people who don’t train in it
author18,I could have built it as an ok war preist damage wise with out doing the combat maneuvers it was just gave nothing special (other weapons could do same and better) and whip had many feats for combat maneuvers.
author2,I think that was realism issue
author18,The problem was the trip and disarm taking way to many feats to work and then not working on monsters.
author13,I think it was a problem with hit bonuses and it's damage was nonexistant
author2,I forget what the problem you guys had with the whip was
author18,The real question is does the whip work in 2e?
author13,100 year old halfling with arthritis coming up
author4,Question are old age penalties in 2e?
author2,animate object is rather pog as a ritual
author4,Cause it 1e it was all demonic and witchcraft except for like 2
author2,yeah they also make having permanent minions make more sense
author4,I like that the rituals in 2e arent all evil and shit lmao
author2,they also did it so it scales depending on the characters level which was something I thought 1e needed
author2,I think it makes more sense and makes things like bringing people back more significant
author2,yeah so is resurrection
author4,You notice reincarnate is a ritual now?
author2,will get you familiar with 2e grappling as well
author2,Yeh thats a good option
author4,Then I'll prob do barb into wrestler for him
author2,that lets you transform
author2,2e barb choose an instinct one of which is animal which gives you natural attacks in rage
author4,May have to multiclass or something but I'll work it out
author4,"If he does return he'll prob either be barb base with the free archetype trying to give him wildshape
Or a druid with an archetype trying to give rage
Unsure how well thatll work though lol"
author4,"Just lmk when you post it
Im fine regardless I just enjoy bringing old characters back lol"
author2,Like I said I don't really have the idea for the one shot yet I just know I want to do one that gives people some idea of how archetype works
author2,K. It could depend in that case.
author4,Early 20s
author2,what race was the barbarian
author2,oh true
author4,Was unsure what the timeline of these one shots really looks like in conparison to each other
author4,If it makes sense character wise then it will be the most likely
author2,Idk the one shot yet but probably fine
author4,Different one shot he ran a while back
author21,The heck is struggle of the sacred tree?
author4,Would bringing back my gestalt barb (ported to 2e) from struggle of the sacred tree work setting wise?
author2,Thinking level 8 with free archetype so people can test that system
author2,Think I’m gonna try and fit in at least one more one shot before it starts
author21,I think I’ll look over the westmarch setting stuff and decide if I want to do that before creating a character for this one
author13,Okay my character is going to be a bomb-selling goblin. One spark could make me lose my entire business
author2,Thetis to be exact
author2,(This takes place in my world fyi)

author4,I take notes on who connects usually fyi
author4,Yeah the f4 ones been on there a whil I always assumed it was Connor but not that I'm trimming the fat on here I'm checking
author3,It might just be another case of someone forgetting to disconnect
author3,"It wouldn't be me, because I disconnected after the session"
author10,I need like 10 minutes
author10,Uno momento
author4,The f4 one
author4,Hey <@146626274066956288> is it you actually

author6,"The issue might be beacuse you are on mobile
Mobile has funky ping issues"
author4,"Any way the point was I was going to ask Law, Randall, and Ephraim if they were interested"
author6,Also discord special
author6,Wait no
author4,I type it and I can only ping myself
author6,Did the chat clear itself?
author4,Why cant I ping Lawrence and Randall
author5,I may consider human cause it might just be straight better
author4,"Correct
Or deal with the Check penalty on atrack rolls"
author6,So if we get the shield or armor then we still need to get proficiency for them right?
author5,No. I might just get the thieves tools and grab leather
author4,You snag proficeny?
author2,I’ll probably grab hide shirt
author4,Btw commoners dont have a favored class Im pretty sure
author4,What gift you leaning towards?
author5,maybe drop int 2 and raise wis
author4,"Btw Setting is in the Crown of the World near the Rimethirst Mountains
Human language is Erutaki"
author4,Im bery interested in what your plan is
author5,my character
author4,Warslinger moment
author5,I think I'll be a halfling
author4,Rich parents?
author5,with 1 trait
author5,I *Could* make a character as strong as a normal character
author5,It has been decided
author5,traits? 2?
author4,"Suggested feats for commoners:
Iron Will, Weapon Proficency, Skill Focus, Catch Off-Guard, Throw Anything"
author4,"Character: 15pt buy, Level 1 Commoner, Any core race
Gear: 1 simple weapon you are proficent with, winter clothes, a backpack, 5gp of gear (+10gp if you have a profession or craft rank)
Setting: The Crown of the World near the Rimethirst Mountains. Bonus human language is Erutaki.

Gifts: The judge gifts one of the following to all gala attendents
Holy Water: 
The Judge is quite superstitious and claims that this water can keep demons and evil spirits at bay .
Thieves Tools:
The judge personally swears that these are a must have for anyone who risks kidnapping or abduction. However, the local criminals seem to have better uses for them.
Hide Shirt:
Emblazoned with the holy symbol of Cayden Caliean this armor matches the patterns of the Judges Guards. Though it seems to be a lighter variety.
Heavy Steel Shield:
Adorned with a stylized rendition of Cayden Caliean's holy symbol this shield is identical to those carried by the Judge's guard.
Ioun Torch:
A floating stone that emits light in the surrounding. While certainly useful, it does make you stand out in a crowd."
author4,"Every year on the day before the winter solstice the generous Judge Travis holds a gala for all the citizens of the neighboring towns. While typical commoners in your town cannot make the journey to the gala, you are a servent of the judge's less generous older brother Lord Richard Holden III.

While returning from the gala you are set upon by a vicious blizzard and seperated from the Lord's Guard. When all hope seemed lost, Lord Holden spots a manor in the distance. Perhaps you will survive to see another day after all..."
author4,Aight Sun at 6:30
author6,Seems like Jacob is planning for Saturday so Sunday works better
author6,Unless Western is planned/planning for one of the
author4,Do you have a day preference
author6,For both
author6,6:15 at the earliest
author4,<@151489352164311040> in particular
author4,<@&927426307514581042> Does Sat or Sun at 6 work for ya'll
author4,"I mean its fine
I just didnt realize we were on
(I have procrastinated map making)"
author2,machine learning time
author2,No sweat off my shoulder though. I forgot it was happening until I saw Fable in the call
author2,Yeah me and Fable both realize that our responses prob weren't confirmation enough
author4,So I just said screw it and studied for midterm
author4,"Cause usually I try and run stuff Sunday
But when I asked about Sat no one confirmed a time or campaign choice"
author4,I didnt prep it
author4,I mean no one said anything so
author4,Was gonna be Sunday but westmarch got scheduled so
author2,how about that airline food
author4,"Honestly I think the level spread should be capped at 2
Cause being the low level in those session sucks, even if you get more xp for it
Also can feel like you get diffed when you schedule a session and the party is all higher than you"
author2,No I knew you were referring to the undead I just was thinking back to normal undead sessions
author4,Yeah not Duergar
author2,was in my fungi folder
author2,I recall now
author2,I don't think we've had draugr
author4,The problem is low level support play sucks
author4,On the case of the shambler & 1st draugr encouter I think that was just a party spread issue with there being a lvl 1
author4,Yeah we are all dps more or less
author2,not enough bards honestly
author4,Yeah but a more unform/traditional party would have split that
author2,cause the resistance was rolled for
author2,That was partially luck and partially comp
author2,Sometimes def. Shuffled caverns became unfortunate when everyone had piercing in the first combat.
author4,Frankly I think it's more a party comp issue than a luck issue
author2,Yeh. There are always gonna be some misses especially when luck is involved
author4,"Tbf some of your encounter's have sucked ass
Though those still have less of a prep time that my 1e duds
(I once again apologize for the skeleton incident)"
author2,or during downtime
author2,2e balancing my beloved. I choose enemies long before the session and then can balance 10 minutes before
author4,The 1e prep agony
author6,6 hour long dual session
author6,Do both
author4,Sat at 6:30 perchance eith Gnome or Wolves (preferably Wolves)
author6,Is when I am free
author6,"Uh anyday after 8
Weds /Thurs /Saturday after 6"
author4,<@151489352164311040> What your schedule
author4,"Trying to get my spring break organized
I got crippled by assignments last week"
author6,Any plans for when the rescheduled session is? or are we waiting till after sans for it?
author4,"May have to cancel/reschedule
Ollie had a harder time than expected with this HW
+they need some time to study for their midterms"
author6,I think that works
author4,1 maybe?
author4,Yeah I mean on Sun
author2,prob whenever but I may have an insurance adjuster coming at some point
author6,Not till sometime sunday
author4,When are people available <@151489352164311040> <@318536129727168512>
author4,Okay I need to move wolves up a bit
author4,Can swap it then
author6,I did not think about that
author6,Free sun
author6,I am busy sat
author6,Wait fuck
author4,Sat then
author1,sounds good :)
author2,either should work
author4,<@589289513788899348> <@318536129727168512> ?
author6,Fine with either
author4,Next Saturday the plan again? Or Sunday?
author7,wait gimme a sec
author4,Am I good to close foundry <@&927426307514581042>
author4,I'm pushing back to 6:30 something came up
author4,Is it something I need to add a token for lol
author4,Summon spells?
author2,beware the summoning
author6,What time are we doing this?
author4,Finx moment
author6,IT WAS
author6,Was it a familiar thing?
author6,But thats only for me
author4,War sight?\
author6,I could have sworn to god I had something to let tristin roll twice for initative once per day
author6,Well I guess those might be the same thing
author6,Ah its being listed as from a feat instead of a class feature
author4,As a note I migrated it a couple version so shit may be bugged
author6,Wait no
author6,"Hold up, I don't think I am getting my cha to saves"
author6,"Ah
Paladin moment with  goated 5th level saves"
author4,You prob renames gaseous cloud
author6,I have a spell called vape cloud?
author4,This is up btw
author4,Ill put foundry up when I get home
author6,Having levels in 3 different classes really makes stuff confusing
author6,Time to remember how my character worked
author6,We didn't level up or anything right?
author4,Okay so Sat? <@&927426307514581042>
author6,5 good
author6,Class canceled
author6,6 should be good
author6,class at 4
author4,Ill prob go with 5 unless Fable needs to start late
author4,<@151489352164311040> ?
author2,I'm good with either
author4,5 or 6?
author2,I can
author4,Wolves Wednesday?
author4,He do be kinda stinky
author2,Also that Lawrence guy 👎
author2,Cause I didn’t feel like traveling 3 weeks in a row
author2,That’s the reason I didn’t go to state
author6,ah oki
author2,Nah it’s next Monday and Tuesday
author6,or is it 23rd and 24th
author6,break is 26th and 27th right?
author2,It’s our fall break
author6,"Unsure, will let you know what happens with work"
author2,I go home next weekend
author4,<@&1064607664216231997> What between Friday and Sunday work for you
author4,<@&1064607664216231997> it time
author2,fine by me
author4,Okay so opinion on starting at 11?
author2,I was assuming we were doing monday
author2,oh I could do early tomorrow
author1,i can't do monday from 2:30-8:45 or so so sunday is the only day i can really make this week
author4,Yeah but <@151489352164311040> works tomorrow night it seems
author2,okay then I'll be good after 3PM
author2,Is the armor medium or heavy
author4,Okay <@&1064607664216231997> we need to work out a time
author5,Bigman will arrive next session. Foli will mention him by that name.
author4,Sorry I had to disappear last minute Mom was getting cranky cause I was lettimg my dinner get cold
author4,6:30 Ollie needs a moment
author6,I concur
author2,I am ready
author4,Like 6 or 6:30
author6,So what time we doing this?
author4,<@151489352164311040> you can put you character in whenever you are ready
author4,<@&1064607664216231997> Foundry is up for ya'll
author2,almost there
author2,Does that == gestalt
author4,<@&1064607664216231997> We'll just go with that
author2,We await the verdict
author4,<@&1064607664216231997> Sun July 30th yes?
author2,but I can put those in chat easily
author2,I lied all of my seance bonuses
author6,"Next week Monday after 4, Wednesday Saturday, Sunday after 3"
author6,"Oh shit wait no
That's for this week, next week things change"
author6,Thursday Saturday and Sunday after 2 are my free days for the foreseeable future
author6,"Oh shit did not notice this chat
Should be good all of this weekend"
author2,so imma join
author4,Oh yeah go ahead lol
author2,someone dropped out of the session that was happening today
author2,The western marches I play in
author2,just asking cause other game slot just opened
author4,Fable never responded so
author2,today or naw
author4,Ohh I knew it was something weird lol
author2,and those can change every time they're channeled
author2,When I channel a caster spirit I get bonus spells
author2,Thats not why
author1,"ill go through the medium spell list, i forgot they're spontaneous, thanks"
author2,other than ill omen it depends on the day
author1,i was stupid and put this in the wrong chat
author1,"by the way, if you guys have any spells or abilities that would inflict debuffs of some sort, could you DM me them (assuming they are not already listed on your foundry sheet)? wanted to make a small folder so i can quickly inflict enemies without having to load the compendium or create a debuff mid-session."
author4,So up to <@151489352164311040>
author4,Though If I rise and grind tonight I could prob run it tomorrow?
author2,I'm not completely certain that is a set schedule in that case
author2,are we talking today or tomorrow or going forward
author4,Im fine to do wike 7:30 to 10 though
author4,Hmm wb Mon or Tues then
author2,increase those times by 1
author2,I also have an hour drive after work so
author4,<@151489352164311040> ?
author4,Try Sat or Sun then?
author2,I work 4-8 wednesday - friday and 10 - 6 on saturday unsure if I work sunday
author4,Im good all the way through Thursday
author4,But what times
author4,True <@589289513788899348>
author2,I continue to exist
author1,"unfortunately i will not be playing this time, i have to DM a game that day"
author4,And recap who is playing at this point
author4,Alright <@&1064607664216231997> time to set a hard date
author4,"Okay what is a regular time that works for ya'lls schedules <@&1064607664216231997>
Rn I'm considering maybe something like 1st Sundays of the month"
author2,nvm on dayjob then
author2,: (
author4,No I think you'll need the enchant for that
author2,This determines the answer to the question
author2,Could I get a bow string tuned to my strength after crafting? Without the enchant.
author4,Or do you mean during campaign?
author4,How much extra do you need
author2,Could we make a day job check for a lil extra cash?
author2,And I'd say the same thing would apply to rituals
author2,This would also give crafting a bit more incentive at lower levels instead of being slightly worse than downtime and then buying the item
author2,This would also make sense for things like stores and how they can be more cost effective
author2,and then like 50 or 100 becomes very easy and then like 1000 is incredibly easy
author2,so say you craft something 10 or 20 times the dc becomes easy
author4,I would also like to have the dc
author2,Considering the idea of having the dc of recipes lower after a certain amount of crafts
author2,Also not having something good to play it in demotivated me as soon as I hit a roadblock
author2,Wanted to make a gun magus but I couldn't make a build I was satisfied with
author2,https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=342 pretty cool
author2,but shield cantrip would work (once)
author6,Sans is basically just a spirit kineticist
author4,Yeah thats how I was leaning
author2,Kineticist blast isn't so I'd say no
author4,"Depends on how ""spells"" are defined in 2e"
author2,would this work or nah
author4,"But yeah it was suppose to do energy which is why I gave it the concentrate trait
But Im illiterate and missed part there"
author4,"Gotcha
Read the harness rules and couldnt tell"
author2,It doesn't
author4,Wait how does shield blocking energy work
author2,Checks out now that that is changed
author4,"I dont think you can shield block spirit damage on the blaster tho
(As a side note the ranged attack has been fixed I had forgot to fix damage type on a copy paste)"
author4,Blocking the melee will prevent the spirit damage
author4,You can't shield block your sins
author2,<@458413180893397022> before it comes up how will you rule this
author2,No they will do bludgeoning
author4,At least I don't have to worry about a Startossing nazi lmfao
author2,Still working on who I will be to fit the build
author4,I dislike this assertion
author2,and the shuriken will be flavored as something else
author2,I'm going to make a very similar build but more dps
author2,I think so
author14,Are construct companions immune to spirit damage?
author2,Also down just struggling to find the right flavor for my build
author14,Count me interested in playing
author4,Anyway stat block shouldn't change much at this point except for adding some relevant tags here and there
author14,Monks are looking really good in general here
author2,monk also highest AC class
author4,He has spirit on his base attack too though so should be fine
author14,Monk only party
author2,and max reflex/fort
author2,alright everyone grab a fortune effect
author4,Ya'll earned it
author2,what if we all crit succeed all the saves
author4,I did a short calculation and I'm way less worried about his hp round 1
author2,summoner and animal companion both work out to 4 actions
author2,tbf so do animal companions
author17,You get to break the action economy at level 1
author17,Summoner is fun
author14,Summoner also gets a lot of actions
author2,not gonna play another one but summoner is a valid option because shared health pool
author2,ranger dedication + basic hunter's trick > hunted shot bouta go crazy
author2,or monastic archery
author14,Shooting Star stance about to be fun
author2,monk and ranger can get 1 action 2 attack with range
author4,To be fair the dodge action lets him move away
author14,Because MAP doesn't matter
author2,not flurry ranger but ranger is good
author14,Try to burn through those reactions
author2,You want more attacks cause the dodge action
author14,Monks and Flurry Ranger
author2,one attack for 2 actions
author2,Nah thats kinda mid
author4,Magus spellstike on it's way to go crazy in the dps department
author2,I think the play is getting as many attacks as you can in a turn prioritizing damage over attack. And don't use companions unless they are immune to spirit damage
author2,compared to a 10d6 cantrip
author2,which wont really do much
author14,"Right, normal hits"
author2,no crits
author14,Because even a normally built wizard crits with their staff swings
author14,Actually the fact that you don’t need to worry about attack rolls at all opens up so many builds
author2,no effects that proc on crit
author2,building for anything related to crits is also off the table
author14,Because they don’t need master in weapon attacks to be useful
author14,Battle Oracle and other half-martials might be okay here
author2,Nah the summoner sacrifice thing
author4,~~Figure out how to get that monk ability to kill yourself~~
author2,I guess because I can't play Mr. shuriken I'll have to play Hitler
author4,I was tempted to make the one shot lvl 19 but figured it's a tad cringe to cuck out on capstones for a reference
author14,They actually farmed for XP
author2,because that is the route that leads to sans being a boss battle
author2,So in theory the players are genocidal maniacs
author4,I'll just add the immunity so he doesn't get cheesed
author4,Found a way
author4,Poison was my other idea but he's immune to that
author14,Ah right
author14,"Soul Siphon, I think"
author14,Bones Oracle
author2,Maybe a spell
author4,Wait how would a player even apply drained to him
author4,Damnit I knew Id miss at least 1 effect that'd insta kill him
author2,smh don't reveal company secrets
author14,Feel like 1 stack of drained would end the fight real quick
author14,That's a funny stat block
author4,I know lmao
author2,I meant for sans
author4,"Tbf Goku would be in a hot minute
Cause ngl
Making meme enemies is hella boring"
author2,We'll see if I care enough to make another character
author4,Goku would in theory use ABP
author13,Like as a meme character but still. Just like piles of loaded weapons
author13,I was unironically trying to make a build like that
author2,I'll save it for if Goku ever happens and I can play Tenten from naruto
author2,^fun idea if anyone wants to in the west march
author2,(with ABP you can do reaper from OW and just have a bunch of loaded guns and quick draw)
author2,Was originally gonna use an air repeater but without ABP it is not very sustainable
author2,"5 shuriken attacks each turn with 300ft range
highest MAP is -2
Opponent becomes off guard after a single attack hits"
author2,very cool build just not useful for Sans
author2,https://pathbuilder2e.com/launch.html?build=680082 Here is a character I may use at some point. No skill feats or ancestry stuff
author4,Still good feedback cause it lets me know none of them look boring lmao
author14,Which I know is rather unhelpful
author14,All of those look interesting
author2,If I end up playing I may just build for big damage hits or something
author4,What out of these looks interesting to people
author4,"**List of all my current/running projects**
Gnome Mercy: I'm not a fecking gnoblin I'm a gnome (1e)
Blight of the Werewolves: combat a werewolf plague, in the haunted country of Ustalav (1e dual class)

author2,I guess I should maybe not make this character in that case
author2,The one annoying thing is I'm building for having good attack bonus
author4,So now that I've got that out of the way
author4,"Originally it was all spirit
But then Inventor would go crazy"
author4,That is actually why I added the bludgeoning and piercing attacks
author2,so I somehow become a mindless construct
author2,Was thinking of how you'd translate the terrakinet to 2e but I think the terrain stuff no longer has a place in 2e
author2,For if anyone wants to discuss anything they are working on or anything like that
author2,Couple maps + couple enemy pics
author2,maps + non-custom monsters down

author6,Slur sword
author6,Imagine this but for mitra
author2,only took 2 hours
author2,if there are any -_-
author2,and the secret doors would show up on a screen shot
author2,No but I want to do foundry
author4,It just too jank to put in mythic table
author7,: (
author2,Time to remake a map in dungeon draft 🙃
author2,Both are like the same amount of almost finished but doing kingmaker is fair to keep it rolling
author6,It seems like every session we have I start clueless with 0 idea whats going on and it takes me a bit to understand whats happening
author6,For me remembering shit at least
author6,I fell like focusing on one of them would be best
author4,Cause I feel like killing Irovetti will likely do that
author4,Do we wanna do wicked or do we want to try and finish the book in king
author2,<@&828644080443326494> Sunday @ 5
author4,Fire bitch is gone
author4,Also this and Kingmaker <@&828644080443326494> need to get sorted out too
author4,"And the fact that this states ""gains a bonus equal to"" instead of adds their Charisma mod seems to indicate that <@151489352164311040> should get double charisma on his Fort save"
author4,"Unholy Resilience (Su): At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws."
author4,So based on the statblocks linked here
author7,: )
author4,For political reasons
author4,Since it isnt the same ttpe of bonus
author4,"Yeah but you lack a Con
Personally I think youd get your Cha to it twice"
author6,Since undead traits
author6,Fort save is mostly useless now though
author4,Btw Cha to fort save <@151489352164311040>
author4,Give me 10 to 15 min
author6,But idk
author6,Might be a little late
author2,Might just give the worg the infernal archetype to simulate that
author2,the summon level increases every 2 levels
author6,Im pretty sure the summon monster level increases
author2,I just realised antipaladin companion is perma summon monster 3 and not animal companion
author4,Yeah so that would make a good ally for low lvl cohorts if we get a new organization
author6,Then it's 34 stealth
author6,Just make it go invisible 5heaf
author2,+3 dex +5 rank +3 class +3 skill focus
author2,Best the worg could get is 14 stealth I think
author4,Would be pretty funny
author4,I want to make a giant with hide in plain sight and a ridculous stealth
author2,the worg never becomes large
author4,Guess the Istocs will do
author2,Large creature so prob not great
author4,We could use a good spy
author4,But whats his stealth
author4,Me and Lawrence could fix that with some Onyx...
author2,Grumblejack has gained the service of a Worg that will likely be out of combat (cause racial hit dice make it severally under leveled)
author7,Working for me rn
author4,Ive tried a few times
author4,Any of yall been able to get Archives to ever work tonight?
author4,Might need extra time to lvl Dorian but should be fine
author6,I still need to figure out leveling shit and if we are doing my grave Knight stiff
author6,Should be good!
author7,but prolly not
author7,we'll see
author2,<@&828644080443326494> tomorrow 6
author7,but my mom will prolly take advantage of that anyways so
author7,im free for once
author6,But I guess that doesn't matter
author6,Work early sat
author4,Barstools n shit
author4,Cant going to greenboro
author2,<@&828644080443326494> early sat into late sun
author6,But I should be good
author6,O fuck I forgot about this
author2,<@&828644080443326494> 6:30?
author7,i dont work
author4,If it says Im good Im good
author2,We both open
author4,Not great service where I am

author6,the goat is the janitor
author4,He can eat shit literally
author4,Put him in the big bathroom
author6,We lock the goat up in the big cell and throw all the trash in there
author4,I feel like the chupacabra will maul that on instinct
author6,Goat to eat our trash?
author6,they are so expensive because they are the only fish that still exists after the fishpocolypse
author4,The oracle could prob catch some if he has a rank in survival
author5,90 gp a piece
author6,those are fish
author6,just get some Gar

author2,<@&828644080443326494> gonna try for tomorrow at early time
author4,"Yknow unless presdigitation helps with smell, I think my bard probably smells like a literal slaughter house"
author4,Cor me
author4,"Hey ya'll I'm going to have to miss this weekend to deal with family matters in the aftermath of my father's death. I'm currently in Stoneville, NC at my grandparents with little to no service. I'm fine with everyone in this chat knowing why I'm busy this weekend but please keep it to yourselves."
author2,Noah being the general
author2,It’s more of a general and his captain thing
author25,That's just the boot camp
author4,I mean I can controll more hd when I get undead master
author25,"Hear me out 
I become a commander of a undead army and Noah becomes the recruiter"
author5,"How Templates will work
1. A template will take a number of levels equal to the CR bonus
2. You will gain the abilities over the span of these levels
3. These abilities will be divided up so you get a similar amount of stuff each level
4. You will get a hit dice for each level equal to your most common hit dice
5. Casters will gain +1 Level of spell casting after the first level in a template
It is basically going to be like a mini prestige class"
author4,You just don't get the buffs
author4,There actually isn't a penalty to using a fervent weapon of a different religion so
author4,Then I can stack it later
author4,So we would just need a +2 equivalent
author4,Your mace us +1 rn
author25,I mean it shouldn't be hard to find a fervent mace
author4,If we go to the capital the buy price may be high enough for fervent though
author4,I'm assuming Mitra is LG and I'm LE
author25,I mean the unholy comes from quirky antipaladin magic
author4,Just not fervent
author4,I can make it heretical though
author4,I can't craft it because I'm 2 steps away from Mitra I think
author4,Idk if you could stack those since it would have to be Mitra attuned
author25,+4d6 to every attack
author25,Unholy heretical mace?
author4,Would need Mitra attunement all the way through
author4,Attuned to Mitra?
author4,So hear me out
author2,This spiked mace
author2,This Morningstar
author4,Would let his spend panach to ignore fumbles
author4,Either way that feat would also allow you to make it flamboyant
author2,Not really
author4,That probably makes it a morning star though
author2,You could put spikes on a mace
author4,I have a build that was a swash with an earthbreaker
author6,Let me stab you with my mace'
author6,ah yes
author4,Are maces simple or martial?
author6,It says i need a percing weapon if i want to regain panache in combat but it doesnt say anything else
author4,I figured you'd need a swash weapon to do that but Parry and Riposte doesn't say that
author4,Hmm thats quirky
author4,But I doubt you plan on finessing anything so
author4,Makes sense
author4,What's your dex?
author6,Im prob going 1 level into swash so i can parry 6+ times a day
author6,multiple ways to get cha to dodge
author6,i was looking at that too
author2,Ephraim tried to do that with AC before
author2,Unless you get it from a single source
author2,Can’t have double ability to a stat
author6,Level 2 swash could give me 2x my charisma to saves
author6,O god
author6,A 1 level  dip sounds nice
author6,In either of the ap's
author6,"Its funny 
whenever i try to teach someone divine casting it never works"
author5,His smite good will also stack so that is cool
author6,"He is my child
my apprentice"
author5,it makes sense for him either way
author5,He'll take it then
author5,I hadn't looked at it
author6,You get diplomacy instead of ride
author6,You are le
author6,Like it does 2 things
author6,I mean looking at tyrant its litterally nothing
author5,I told you at the start that I made an exception when it came to this
author6,So he would also have to be a tyrant like me
author6,Ye he is
author6,Is grumblejack lawful?
author5,an antipaladin who has sided with villains bent on conquest
author5,dread vanguard antipaladin is literally the definition of grumble jack
author6,Its an asmodeus approved archtype
author6,Hungry Ghost Monk?
author4,So hear me out
author5,"I know but smite, judgment, and bane are a lot of things"
author4,Meant judgment
author4,SMite and bane stack I'm pretty sure
author6,He goes Knight of the Sepulcher an becomes a ghetto undead
author5,he already got smite though
author4,I kinda like the idea of Hellknight Grumblejack inquisitor of Asmodeus
author5,oozemorph shifter?
author4,"Uh only spells on my radar rn are Full Pouch, Greater Magic Aura, Beloved of the Forge, Remove Disease, and maybe Glitterdust"
author6,"Make him a cleric of Cayden Cailean
but use this ""archtype"""
author5,make him a paladin
author6,Bed of iron
author5,Any spells that you guys need that you can t get
author4,Ranger favored enemy could be handy
author4,Barb would just pile damage on
author4,"What would he get retrained as?
Him being an Inquisitor could be sick"
author4,Yeah I noticed that when I have more hp than him
author4,Makes sense
author5,he has 8 hit dice
author4,What's his Cr?
author5,and yes he is 6 levels beind you
author4,And he doesn't level at the same rate as us does he?
author4,True but wouldn't he lose some feats?
author5,He can do that as a different class
author4,I feel like his vital strike has been pretty on point
author4,Gimmie a sec working on something large due at midnight
author5,Thoughts <@!458413180893397022>
author5,erase grumblejack
author6,Rerace grumblejack into a small race
author5,If you have any preference over fighter
author5,You guys could retrain grumble jack
author6,Have grumblejack retrain into a druid and wild shape all the time
author5,Can also just keep grumble jack in the cart as much as possible
author7,"""Grumblrjack"" just made me die, holy shit idk why I found that so funny"
author4,"We can just go with the disguise of grumblrjack being an enlarged dwarf with the circlet
Though a detect magic + spellcraft sees through it regardless of if they see through the disguise"
author2,You can get Randall’s items
author4,Actually nvm seems no such spell exists
author4,Also we may need someone to grab reduce monster for grumblejack
author4,"2 the oracle can tske the strength gauntlets and swap his multibelt for the bulls con belt
3 I can salvage materials from his wakizashis"
author4,Because 1 we can give his circlet to grumblejack
author4,Hey we looted Randall for magic items right?
author4,Yeah that works for Carrion
author4,"Imagine not having a lovecraftian monstrosity as a ""familiar"""
author6,Think a kangaroo fucked a rat
author7,I just haven't existed it
author7,A gerboa
author7,I do...
author6,I think he does
author4,Lawrence do you have a familiar?
author4,Mfw Old One Eye has fast healing 7
author7,I choose Yay
author6,for this
author7,For wot
author6,Thats the one
author6,And its a necromancy spell
author6,Beacuse paladin has it
author6,I feel like i should though
author4,But yeah <@!151500793990742016> yay or nay?
author6,I do in fact not
author6,Im pretty sure i do
author4,Would be kinda funny
author4,Do you have the spell that lets you sleep in armor?
author6,"When thorn said this i took it literally 
Now im turning my armor into my skin"
author4,Add to list in <#872558532719960115>
author4,I can craft that now lmao
author6,As long as we enhance my armor
author4,But anyway yay or nay?
author4,But can it provide +2 hp for all of old one eys hd?
author6,"idk bout that last one
my body is already a temple for asmodeus"
author4,So 6725 gp total for all the undead stuff
author4,"5000 for bag of holding IV (can also store stuff like the cauldron and the tears)
700 onyx for one eye, 75 onyx for fast zombies, 350 onyx for Atlas, and 200 for Carrion
200 to convert the portable hole into a botany/alchemist lab + crafting shop
200 for an altar to Asmodeus to buff these undead when I make them (+2 hp per hd)"
author4,Also <@&828644080443326494> add weapons to the magic item list I can craft shit now
author4,I mean I'm sure there are plenty of books where you lose to the big bad at the end for a revenge arc
author2,My head cannon is that when a barbarian goes down while raging all of their wounds basically grow
author2,You stopped them from finishing book 1 though
author4,Like they will be chasing us for a while
author4,They look like the protags of the story lol
author4,Well those guys seem like they would have some
author5,cause I have NPC hero points
author5,I'll use one
author4,Cannonicaly I like to think that mage used a hero point on that crawl
author6,Is normal time 4 or 5?
author2,<@&828644080443326494> it is time
author2,Also doesn’t really matter if it dies
author4,Makes sense
author4,What does the bull heal with it
author6,Its called smite good
author6,Its alright i have the improved version of protect from good
author4,I formally thank him
author5,He'll replace protection from good communal with it
author5,its an even number level so...
author5,The oracle can get it next level
author4,"I'll be able to grab it at lvl 12 but that's a little ways off
Would be helpful for necrocrafts and Artephius"
author4,Hey between the oracle and lawrence is it possible for one of you guys to grab make whole?
author7,It indeed
author5,it really is
author4,It bathroom one sec
author5,<@&828644080443326494> oog
author4,Fine with me
author6,Works for me
author5,"<@&828644080443326494> wanna start at 12? I would like to get done a bit earlier, but we don't have to."
author6,I would be good tommorow
author7,idk bout tommorow but should be good for the weekend
author4,All of those work for me
author6,Ill tell you when i know
author6,Might not be good tommorow
author6,Good this weekend
author5,"<@&828644080443326494> I can do tomorrow early time, Saturday early time, and Sunday early or normal time"
author2,2 minutes
author4,It doesn't really matter anyway lol
author2,If no one is level 9 on their sheet and it says you aren’t supposed to be level 9 at this point I assume you aren’t level 9
author4,And I could have sworn you said to lvl up before confronting the other party
author4,Yeah but in wotw we killed the mercenaries
author2,No kingmaker was last. You guys about to raid fort shits
author7,Cuz I swear at the end of whatever it was  you were like oh yeah you leveled up
author7,What was the last thing we did
author2,K so you haven’t leveled up recently
author4,I think so
author2,You should be level 8 right
author2,What level your character
author4,I thought we did after killing the gnome
author2,Not in wotw
author6,Did we level up?
author7,indeed he says
author5,I says indeed
author7,today he says
author5,<@&828644080443326494> today at 1
author4,You know we probably need to hit the castle soon in wotw
author2,Gotta go get some shid done so I’m not sure on if I’ll be done on time
author4,Eating lunch
author4,One sec
author7,"Mom said we might be going to asheville tommorow, so it'll be a iffy"
author6,also have family coming for a bit but they should be here early so it shouldnt matter
author6,id leave at 6 but im gonna guess we would be done by then
author4,Probably idk
author5,<@&828644080443326494> tomorrow at 1
author4,According to d20pfsrd it's DC 25
author4,I'm not sure if it has a craft DC though
author4,Hey <@318536129727168512> can I attempt a craft alchemy check to collect ghost salt from ash mans remains
author6,i just did my actions and that was all
author4,So did anything interesting happen after ash man
author7,: (
author4,Feinting is kinda trash if you don't take feats for it
author4,Weapon focus ups attack specialization ups dmg
author6,or i guess instead of those i could just take 10 to feint
author6,"whats better greater weapon focus, or weapon specialization"
author4,I grabbed remove curse
author4,Charisma moment
author4,We get a 2nd +1 huh
author4,Isitoqs have 2hd but count as 1hd undead
author4,Yknow what us quirky
author4,Nvm it does
author4,Hey does the chupacabra keep the grab quality on it's bite?
author4,Thats much more in line with the minotaur
author4,So does 26 sound right for 4d8+8
author4,One sec
author4,Oh I get it now
author2,Round down
author2,"They get 3.5 for d6, 4.5 for d8, 5.5 d10, 6.5 for d12"
author2,If they have 2d8 they get 9
author4,Hey when doimg monster hp do they get the average on every hit die
author4,Makes sense
author2,Prestige class
author4,Ah I see
author2,He didn’t get spells this level
author4,Hey did the oracle grab remove curse?
author5,The fire boy getting fire sword would be pleasing
author5,He also gets the ability to cone channel or line channel
author5,3rd level all his cure spells are empowered on himself
author5,next level the oracle gets the ability to bleed
author4,Sounds aesthetically pleasing
author5,"Things Oracle would like
+1 heavy steel shield
that +1 flaming longsword"
author4,Especially the Dislikes: you
author4,Seems accurate
author6,google images
author7,where'd u find it
author6,Is this pathfinder cannon?
author7,i thoguht u said feel really nice and spicy
author6,"and "" it will feel really nice and squishy"""
author6,its only 80$
author6,so i was looking at Asmodeus on google and i found a real life unholy symbol
author6,i mean he already let me be his antipaladin so i dont see a reason he would not support my attempts to lengthen my time serving him
author4,Yeah but idk if asmodeus was in on that bit
author6,and ive been engaging in a crusade in his name for like the past 5-6 levels
author6,"and i already have a patron , his name is asmodeus"
author6,the problem is finding good tieflings
author6,the problem isnt finding tieflings
author4,Nor do I need a patron
author4,Well at least I don't have to go on a tiefling hunt in the country with no tieflings
author4,Lich moment
author6,25k sounds a lot better than 120k
author6,already sent him this
author4,For Tristin's use
author6,im sure theres a way
author4,Might be hard to find the last one
author6,and kill 13 good tieflings
author6,so according to pfsrd the only cost to become a graveknight is i must spend 25000 improving my armor
author6,when life doesn't like you

Will need to stop by the dining hall after my laundry finishes"

author5,Could the oracle take out a loan of 1175 gp?
author5,You tried to meditate
author10,no one told me why i went insane
author5,Yeah but it got cured
author10,i went insane right
author5,Your character has basically sat in the corner for several weeks
author5,or make any other skill checks outside of combat
author5,Just because you have low charisma doesn't mean you cant speak
author10,she is good at it
author10,kingmaker gathlain is much better for that
author5,Thats the worst excuse
author10,my character is dogwater at social encounter
author5,You ignore social encounter and actively seek out combat. idk what else to say
author5,"In a phrase ""Murder hobo"""
author5,"plus even when you do play you aren't ""here"""

author5,But right now I don't know the days of the funeral
author5,Should also be able to do it once this weekend
author5,If you can send me like a magic item crafting order I can cover that for the time you aren't there
author5,and you could still join part of the way through
author5,its wotw so not much of importance is gonna happen
author5,So not this week hours
author7,that makes me sad
author4,I'd have to haul ass back here
author25,630 maybe?
author4,Free on fridays though
author5,Now it is up to Noah
author25,It should work for me
author5,and I have work Thursday
author5,and friday is birthday
author10,maybe chance
author5,Cause I have to attend a funeral this weekend
author5,<@&828644080443326494> whats the % chance of tomorrow?
author6,i was looking at it on my phone so it was a bit confusing
author6,o ic
author5,das not a room
author25,You fool now I want to construct a thieves guild in my room
author5,https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/downtime/rooms-and-teams/ this gives prices on setting up different rooms and also ideas for stuff you guys could add
author5,<@&828644080443326494> might not be a bad idea to divvy out some money for furnishing rooms
author4,Everyone goes to Lawrences house without him
author2,Will just start at the first time without Lawrence
author6,well 115
author2,Everything is moved up an hour
author2,We will just pick you up at exactly 1
author4,Double crazy
author6,its actually <@&828644223095275611>
author7,<@&828644080443326494> Will have to move the time to arrive to like 1:30 because mom said ill have to be at the daycare till about 1
author4,If I had to guess probably not
author6,since it has a brain
author6,can the golem be affected by mind affecting effects?
author4,"I like how one of the versions of attonement is basically ""join me and together we will rule the the galaxy"""
author5,Ifrit falls into the few range
author5,mhmm I mentioned that
author5,"Enlarge person works on Humans, Dwarves, Ratfolk, Tengu, Literal fucking monkey, and giants
Doesn't work on most half humans Aasimar, Tiefling, Oread, Ifrit, etc."
author4,"Hold monster, enlarge monster, etc are like 2 spell lvls higher"
author4,You'd have to use the monster version of spells on them
author4,But that's hella quirky
author4,Didn't think they were after Randall pointed that out
author5,Raw a tiefling or aasimar wouldn't be humanoid either
author5,Cause humanoid is described as having few supernatural abilities
author5,Things that are not organic or full angels and shit are a different thing
author4,Silicon based lifeforms are the problem
author4,Too much rock idk
author5,I don't see why enlarge person would work on a tengu but not a oread
author4,Actually alot of buffs wouldn't work if you aren't humanoid
author5,I see no reason this definition doesn't match https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/
author4,I think humanoid is supposed to be a biology thing less than a shape thing
author5,That will apply for enemies as well as you guys
author5,<@&828644080443326494> so that shit is less confusing. My ruling going forward is that if you are humanoid shaped you are humanoid. Cause that shit just makes no since. This will apply to both campaigns.

author2,For Lawrence’s sake
author6,i would say tommorow then
author2,Wednesday I’d have to leave at 4:30
author6,but im fine for either
author6,tommorow i would have to leave at 8
author2,<@&828644080443326494> we can either do it tomorrow at the normal time or Wednesday at the early time. What would everyone prefer? And someone message Randall.
author4,I'm free whenever except for Saturday
author6,I would be fine with earlier time
author5,<@&828644080443326494> Can't do wednesday night so we either need to move to a different day or do the earlier time. Up to you guys. Also probably can't do friday.
author5,someone should @randall cause he has me blocked
author4,Sounds good
author5,unless there is a unanimous vote to do it sooner
author5,<@&828644080443326494> wednesday and thursday mostlikely
author6,ill put that in my notes
author4,"Bianca DeBitch Ass

author2,<@&828644080443326494> tomorrow at 1 probably
author7,Tj is right though
author10,shut the fuck up
author25,Your internet seems good enough for you to bitch
author10,My internet is dogshit so I can't do anything
author4,Would prefer Kingmaker personally
author5,Also we can do kingmaker or way of the wicked depending on how people are feeling
author7,Just kinda waiting to see if mom still wants me to come
author7,"Basically same situation once again
Replacing lowes with the attic"
author4,So I can make it for now
author4,Still trying to but unlikely
author4,Didn't even go to Lowes
author6,he has an internet lounge
author7,home for now
author6,dont forget <@!146626274066956288>
author5,how is it looking <@!458413180893397022> <@!151500793990742016>
author6,in call
author5,<@!151489352164311040> wanna join a call and I can tell you a bit more info you find in the orphanage
author5,"So since we are doing a single cohort for the whole party it is going to work a little different if multiple people take leadership. (Also followers are additive) 
1 person has leadership: Cohort acts normal
2 people: The Cohort is only one level lower
3 people: The Cohort gets +2 skill ranks per level
4 people: The Cohort gains a bonus feat that one of the people with leadership has
5 people: The Cohort gets a +2 to a stat"
author6,so 85 checks
author2,Probably closer to 100 orphans
author6,how many more checks do i need to roll?
author2,Btw <@151489352164311040> I drastically underestimated the number of orphans. It is a big orphanage.
author2,But death
author6,Circle of evil
author2,It’s the circle of death
author6,dont forget the part where you feed your minions with the garden
author4,Use soul gems to craft magic items sounds better
author5,"Reduce- Kill minions or let them get killed
Reuse- Make them undead
Recycle- Use the bones to fertilize your garden"
author4,Skeleton Champion cohort sounds pog
author6,Undead leadership
author5,"Also known as reduce, reuse, recycle"
author5,Leadership + Undead Master
author4,Leadership < Undead Master
author5,<@&828644080443326494> reading up on stuff and it would be beneficial if multiple people take leadership. Mainly those with high charisma. It would still be beneficial even with no charisma though.

author5,"9. That Sergeant Hallack is a coward! He quit the army 
and now lets all his comrades march to war why he sits 
on his duff, drinking his cares away. 
10. Have you seen Bianca DeVallya? She plays at 
Canton’s Canter almost every night. She’s an angel -- the 
most beautiful lass I’ve ever seen! 
11. Sister Marta saved my life. I’ll never be able to repay that blessed angel of Mitra. 
12. Those strange hills in the Briar are haunted no two 
ways about it. Anyone who goes there isn’t coming back! 
13. The Bugbears are marching towards Farholde! 
We’ve got evacuate the city! 
14. Old One-Eye’s back. He’s half-tiger, half-devil that 
old cat! Big as a house! 
15. Lorringsgate’s ... gone! Can you believe it? First 
Balentyne and now Lorringsgate! Can anyone stop these 
monsters? 
 16. The Knights of the Alerion have gone mad and 
are blaming the invasion on the temple of Asmodeus. 
They’re burning anyone with a black cat at the stake! It’s 
madness! There hasn’t been a cult of Asmodeus in Talingarde for twenty years. Someone’s organizing the bugbears, surely, but Asmodeans? Ha! 
17. Lord Welshire may have gone to war but at least 
Sir Valin still mans the Castle Farthyn. A knight of true 
noble blood, he is! Why, they say he is distant kin of the 
Victor himself! 
18. The Baron Vandermir is a strange one! The elf 
hardly ever leaves his manor these days. 
19. The Baron Vandermir is the most generous man 
I’ve ever met. It’s because of him this town has an orphanage. 
20. The kids at the Vandermir Orphanage are little 
more than thugs! I hear the corrupt old baron sometimes 
uses them for muscle."
author5,"2. On the northern edge of the Caer Bryr are those 
strange hills called the Karst. They say somewhere in 
those hills is lost a great treasure! 
3. It’s impossible those bugbear brutes could have broken the Watch Wall without help. Someone has betrayed 
us! 
4. My poor Jeffy has gone to war. I hope he’s alright! 
5. The Caer Bryr is full of living trees -- everyone 
knows that, but its rare to see them so far north. Still, 
I’ve heard tell that one dwells not a day’s ride from this 
very tavern! 
6. Did you hear about the elf staying at the Wandering 
Friar Inn that disappeared now three weeks back? Went 
into the Briar and weren’t never seen again! 
7. Before Lord Welshire left, he had a priest of Mitra 
conjure up an angel to guard the town. If anyone gives 
us trouble, that angel will show ‘em what for. 
8. Did you hear Hallack Amon paid off his father’s 
debts? It almost broke the poor lad. What will he do for 
money now that he’s left Watch?"
author5,"1. Lord Welshire has taken the army and gone to join 
the war. What if monsters from the Caer Bryr attack? 
We’re defenseless!"
author5,hors d’oeuvres
author4,I was expecting that actually
author2,<@&828644080443326494> considering I’ve annotated 1/2 the next book of WotW and haven’t read any of the next book of kingmaker we are going to try and do WotW Tuesday.
author4,Got it
author4,Also are we planing to do mainly Kingmaker this week
author5,Is this small enough
author4,Will join in a sec doing something
author4,What about a miniscule e
author5,<@&828644080443326494> gigga E
author4,Okay now I get it
author2,You get a point for each
author4,I mean the two campaigns
author2,No you each get point. I’ll just give Randall his a little early.
author4,So is it 1 point between the two?
author6,"randalls birthday hasnt happend?
afaik"
author4,Makes sense
author2,I forgot to give you yours on your birthday
author2,You get hero point on birthday
author10,still no comprende
author2,<@458413180893397022> <@146626274066956288>
author2,So just Randall and Noah
author2,You both get the because birthday
author10,All have 1
author4,Dp we all have 1 or do we share
author6,cuz were now level 6 and we mostly saved the boy
author4,Why in Kingmaker
author10,that's what he said
author4,Wait both campaigns?
author10,Or do they come back
author10,Okay so basically they're a consumable?
author10,Why do we get them?
author2,Randall also
author2,Also Noah forgot to tell you yesterday but you get a heropoint in both campaigns
author4,Got it
author5,That will prob be after 5:30
author2,Anyways I would like to try and get everyone in a call for like 15 minutes today so I can communicate the last parts of book 1.
author4,Or is that for you to know and us to find out
author2,Book 2 hit different
author4,My saves are fine
author5,Also should decide on someone who isn't oracle or TJ to get cloak of resistance
author5,btw nothing says life link is positive energy so it should work on undead
author4,Oracle > Cleric honestly
author5,Also 7 uses of 3d6 channel and 7 uses of 3d6 lay on hands. Both heal him 6 more
author4,Honestly between that and mystery stuff oracles have the same amount if spells as a cleric pretty much
author5,Majority of his spells are bonus spells
author4,The bonus cure spells thing is pretty neat
author5,Spell list
author4,Or he could have just split it between him TJ and Randall
author5,1 minute so 10 rounds for everyone
author4,How long it last
author5,mfw oracle had protection from good communal
author4,But double check how scrolls work first
author4,The oracle should take that scroll I think
author5,If he does tacitus also had a pouch
author4,Does Lawrence need components?
author5,Oracle can hold on to that +1 greatsword as well
author6,i mean could i dual wield armor?
author10,I do not want to slow down
author5,you okay with that
author4,Well it doesn't fit me and I don't think Randall would want to slow down
author5,Oracle should also prob take that +1 breastplate if that is okay
author4,I should just give Lawrence half my stuff since I overprepare and he underprepares
author4,Si and buy a phychic kit
author5,LAwrence should prob take the masterwork dagger so he can cut things if necessary
author4,Also I get a new necromancy spell this level
author4,First the disguise and bluffs and now this
author4,Why the TJ always nat 20 on shitposts
author6,the exact same thing exept the oricle falls in before the table locks the trapdoor
author2,Hits oracle. Oracle rolls reflex to dodge. If he fails fall down ladder.
author4,What would have happened if he rolled super low
author5,the tables... have turned
author4,The table play was the real mvp
author6,25 ac gang
author6,makes sense
author5,It specifically said he prefers not to use it in his lab
author4,Also it's really funny to me that the Tactius was actually gonna fireball us
author4,If we get to an area with a high enough buy price
author4,We are so loaded we can just buy a headband
author6,but i get the medals
author5,head undead moment
author4,I want to take Lord Havylen's head
author5,"Extra use of lay on hands, channel, and 2nd level spell"
author6,but i could get to high ac
author4,Ups all his shit
author4,Yeah honestly
author5,Better for oracle
author6,my headband
author5,bird seed and padded armor
author4,Makes sense
author5,He didn't have shit
author4,Did we hit Mad Martin's room?
author5,I'll put that in the treasury

author2,I’m just asking cause I know most people get off work and can pick up kids before 4
author7,Also i will
author7,To help?
author2,Send character sheet screenshots then. Why do they need you at 4?
author7,They need me?
author7,i hav to go back to careday at 4

author5,map set up for tommorow
author2,That is what I said
author10,Can he show it off for just a second for intimidation factor
author5,pretty much
author5,So no one out of combat unless he wants to
author5,It is only to people he considers enemies
author4,Well I mean I feel like people would noticecaura of cowardice
author5,It isn't an actual problem because it can only be seen/noticed with detect evil
author4,I think
author4,No nvm would need greater
author4,Can the magic aura spell hide that?
author4,Yeah rn he has an aura of strong evil
author2,Honestly I don’t think TJ theoretically should be allowed in town
author4,Rn it lasts 1d6 × 10 minutes
author6,and it lasts 1d6 days
author4,I like that at lvl 11 TJ's aura of evil becomes overwhelming

out tomorrow. I wonder how long they’ll be gone 
this time? The last time they were gone for five 
days! If you ask me, these patrols are a waste of

duty."

people and has named every one!"

rank and file soldiers in Balentyne.)"
author5,"20. Do you know how the Lord’s Dalliance got its

be a secret passage to the basement that allowed 
the Lord of the Watchtower to sneak in here and 
have a good time. Of course it must have been 
sealed up years ago."
author5,"7. They say the bugbears are massing up north. I 
wonder what their up to? Well, it doesn’t matter!

the Watch Wall is unbreakable!"

them was caught picking a man’s pocket."

to a drinking contest. He’ll drink you under the

author5,<@!151500793990742016> Make carroter
author5,I think that is more because its a common thing for evil outsiders to have
author4,I mean ward from evil protects against it
author5,In pathfinder world not evil
author5,In real world evil
author5,Self defense gang
author4,"I mean thats the ""what if I kill the murderer"" logic"
author10,and you stop them from doing it
author10,what if their will is bad
author10,not true
author4,I mean forcing someone to do something against their will is inherently bad
author10,it is your choice if it is good or bad
author10,it is simply imposing will
author4,No thats pretty bad
author10,not good or bad
author10,it simply is
author10,mind overpower
author10,because its sorta a fae thing i guess?
author4,So why tf does dominate person not have the evil descriptor
author7,= = =
author4,Fedora = true neutral evil
author2,Hat = head covering of any kind
author4,Fire may be a problem
author10,unless i get hair to cover it
author10,the pointy ears may make a problem though
author10,unless they're racist towards darker skinned humans too
author10,my char doesn't need paint
author10,ok so basically
author10,short too
author10,young anyways
author10,basically my char is like
author4,Can't have hw
author10,wanna join gamer? <@!458413180893397022>
author10,that's normal
author10,ignore the firey hair
author10,and uh
author10,i am just sunburned really badly
author4,I'll disguise myself as child
author4,They hate my beats cause of racism
author5,but it wont be as bad
author5,They still wont like you as much as human
author5,No it should be fine
author4,Gnome isn't too unusual I don't think
author5,Lawrence is human
author5,so is randall
author5,TJ gonna need paint cause his ass is blue
author5,NPC can clean up a little and be fine
author4,You do not see horn
author6,"""hey your the evil guy"" "" actually no"""
author5,NPC is tiefling but has pass as human
author6,i mean can a really high bluff work as a disguse
author5,Yeah. They hella racist in this area
author4,When Randall said he had horns I realized it
author4,You know people playing unusual races might want ranks in disguise
author4,Aight np
author2,Lawrence = stupid
author7,something = lawrence
author2,Also be thinking about what hat would look good on your character
author5,or something
author5,for anyone
author5,background trait = normal trait

author4,Yeah np
author5,It says it is fine for you guys to see this but I'd like to switch to the stats the AP has
author5,Okay so basically I just found out that this AP has stats and stuff built in so
author6,i think
author4,Is the 16 before racial mods
author4,Aight sounds good
author5,20 point buy can't put a base stat above 16
